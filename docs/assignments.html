<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reading-annotations">Reading Annotations</h2>
<p>Each week a selection of course readings will be posted as a single assignment on Perusall - a system for students to collaboratively annotate course readings. To earn this credit, you will be expected to post 3 quality annotations per assignment to Perusall. A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each other’s annotations. <strong>Annotations must be completed before class to receive credit.</strong></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="field-notes">Field Notes</h2>
<p>Ethnographers keep field journals to thickly document what they observe in social environments. Typically field notes will describe a physical environment and the participants in that environment (including appearances, roles, behaviors, moods, interactions, conversations, etc.). Field notes will also interpret what was observed, considering how the empirical material affirms, contests, or transforms how we understand cultural phenomena. In data ethnography, the social environment under consideration can be anywhere data is produced, applied, presented, or talked about. This assignment is about paying attention to the numbers (and other forms of data) that inhabit daily life and practicing cultural interpretation.</p>

<p>Consider a statistic, dataset, data standard, data infrastructure, or data collection environment that you encountered <strong>in the past two weeks.</strong> Write 300-400 words, first, detailing the environment and, second, responding to one of the following prompts.</p>
<ul>
<li>What cultural assumptions about what knowledge is and how knowledge is produced can you glean from this data environment?</li>
<li>How do binary oppositions structure discourse about data in this environment? With what consequences?</li>
<li>What metaphors are used to characterize data in this environment, and what assumptions about data are conveyed through these metaphors?</li>
<li>What is one master narrative architecturally designed into this data infrastructure? How does that narrative manifest both semiotically and materially through the data infrastructure?</li>
<li>What invisible forms of labor sustain this data infrastructure or data environment? How do the individuals that engage in that labor approach and care for their work? What social forces render that work invisible?</li>
<li>How is data science defined in this space? Through what kinds of boundary work do social groups advocate for what should count as legitimate data science? What are the social consequences of this definitional work?</li>
<li>What counts as credible data expertise in this data environment? How do these ideas mediate who gets a voice in the data environment?</li>
<li>In what ways are data practices embodied in this environment? How does attention to embodied practice change the ways we understand the data?</li>
<li>What rituals do data collectors engage in this data environment? What shared beliefs motivate these rituals, and how do the rituals manifest in the “raw” data that gets produced?</li>
<li>What stakes do individuals have in how numbers in this data environment get reported? How do social or financial incentives to have the numbers meet or beat certain thresholds animate how individuals behave and the choices they make in relation to this data collection practice, data analysis, or data reporting? Why do those incentives exist?</li>
<li>How is the meaning of this statistic or data value socially debated, negotiated, or settled upon? At what thresholds do the data values become actionable, and how do social groups determine levels of actionability? How and under what conditions do these decisions get made?</li>
<li>How are data socially mobilized in this space? What strategies do individuals, institutions, or social groups engage to render the data persuasive?</li>

<p>For this assignment, you will select a standard classification system that supports a dataset or system. You will then investigate that information infrastructure through a socio-cultural lens, aiming to respond to the question: <em>What is a cultural assumption embedded in this classification system that goes on to shape the social outcomes of the data it supports?</em> You may briefly research the history of changes to the infrastructure; however, this assignment is <em>not a literature review</em>, and you should limit your use of secondary sources to support your arguments. This paper should represent <strong>your</strong> cultural analysis of this dataset, not that of others. To do so, you should closely examine the structure of the classification system, using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_PJonz8IvLEazYZZyDANUqTfMh2xT_fTkIdMViJpcE/copy">Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet</a>.</p>
<section id="selecting-a-data-infrastructure" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="selecting-a-data-infrastructure">Selecting a data infrastructure</h3>
<p>Before you select an infrastructure, you should identify a public dataset that organizes information into a series categories</p>
<p>Examples of classification systems that I’ve seen referenced in public datasets include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Industrial Classification System (SIC) or the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)</li>
<li>Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</li>
<li>BISAC Subject Headings List</li>
<li>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)</li>
<li>Uniform Crime Reporting crime classifications</li>
<li>Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Computing Classification System</li>
<li>Candid’s Philanthropy Classification System (PCS)</li>
</ul>

<section id="analyzing-the-data-infrastructure" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analyzing-the-data-infrastructure">Analyzing the data infrastructure</h3>
<p>To analyze this infrastructure, you should complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_PJonz8IvLEazYZZyDANUqTfMh2xT_fTkIdMViJpcE/copy">Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet</a>, which you will submit along with the final write-up. You should aim to answer most of the questions in this worksheet, but you do not need to answer all of them. To answer these questions, you can rely on a diverse range of resources. First and foremost, you should browse the classification system itself, noting how concepts are organized. However, to answer the questions in the worksheet, you may also need to review the websites of the organizations that created/steward the classification, review changelogs that identify changes to the classification, and conduct research to find journal articles, news articles, blog posts, or other grey literature, discussing the classification.Finally, you should consider how everything you learned shaped the way values are presented in the dataset where you originally identified this infrastructure.</p>
</section>
<section id="write-up" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="write-up">Write-up</h3>
<p>Following your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo presenting an an answer to the question: <em>What is a cultural assumption embedded in this classification system that goes on to shape the social outcomes of the data it supports?</em> I encourage you to use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sajXtloivgvp7OPlYdS8kiZaIKlfBoTxF4lhjVbEqyQ/copy">memo template</a> for outlining your write-up. You should engage thick description as you detail the structure and organization of the infrastructure and interpret its symbolic meaning.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that this is not a literature review, and you should not approach this assignment simply by regurgitating what you learn in sources you find. Instead, you should focus on analyzing the ways in which the infrastructure both enables and delimits knowledge production by closely studying how its component parts are organized and how they impact your dataset, along with which stakeholder groups advocated for certain changes. The sources you find should serve to provide context for the points that you make. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.</p>

<p>Following the framework in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RxKuCVHWPJMPmUP9oIknHMJZpdfbu5qialKqeLeJwNg/copy">Discourse Analysis Worksheet</a>, you should examine how data is talked about in the video(s). Consider the epistemologies vocalized, the binary oppositions that structure the language, the rhetorical strategies used, and what this tells us about data culture. You should take detailed notes by responding to several sections within the worksheet. As “data” to back up claims regarding what you notice about the discourse, you should transcribe a series of quotes from the talks. You can add these quotes directly to the worksheet. <strong>You will submit the worksheet with your final write-up.</strong></p>

<p>If you choose this assignment, it will be your responsibility to identify a data professional, reach out to them (cc’ing me), and coordinate an interview time well in advance of the project due date. There is a template for emailing an individual provided <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BMyZhimQx0WFa3p1VO7td9uBdOkF9sWbgtY0OCcBeMs/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>, along with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yAUYtoW09Htzn7BHhQS7pikm_RR4G1Zp_ITIBpU7eRM/edit?usp=sharing">a consent form</a> the person you interview should sign. Keep in mind that, while your SDS professors may be an obvious first choice, they cannot support interviews with all of the students in our course. I encourage you to think expansively about who you might interview. I’m happy to offer suggestions on identifying an appropriate person in office hours.</p>

<p>For this assignment, you will observe a setting in which data figures centrally. You may choose to observe a class engaging in some form of data collection, a hack-a-thon, or even a friend working on a coding assignment for a data science course. The only data setting that I discourage for this assignment is talks that are being presented on-line. These are better suited for the discourse analysis mini-project. As you observe, you will be aiming to gather data that addresses one of the following two questions: 1) How are data practices embodied in this data environment, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data? OR 2) What rituals are engaged in this data, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-project">Final Project</h2>
<p>In May 2009, Data.gov - a web portal for accessing US government datasets - was launched by then federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra. Following this, in December 2009, then US President Barack Obama signed the Open Government Data Directive, requiring that all federal agencies post at least 3 high value datasets on data.gov within 45 day. A few years later in May 2013, Pres.&nbsp;Obama signed an Executive Order to: “Mak[e] Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information.”</p>
<p>The Order required that the US Office of Management and Budgeting, in collaboration with the CIO and CTO, put out and oversee an Open Data Policy. This policy required the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data needs to be published in machine-readable formats</li>
<li>Data needs to be licensed openly</li>
<li>Data needs to be described with metadata.</li>
</ul>
<section id="prompt" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prompt">Prompt</h3>
<p>For this assignment, I would like you to imagine that the Data.gov Program Management Office in US General Services Administration Technology Transformation Services, the Office of Government and Information Services (OGIS), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are jointly championing a new initiative to improve the accessibility of open government metadata. Administrative metadata describing how datasets are managed or stewarded gets published with most open government datasets. Similarly, descriptive metadata gets published in the form of data dictionaries that provide official definitions of observations and variables present in the dataset. However, user-friendly descriptions of how the dataset was produced, how standard definitions were chosen, how categories were divided, how measurements get taken, what assumptions and judgments are built into the data, why certain information may be missing, and where and how the data gets referenced is often harder to come by and rarely published in a succinct format accessible to diverse users.</p>
<p>To help advance this initiative, imagine the offices will be contracting with a number of teams of consultants to develop a series of dataset user guides. Unlike many existing metadata formats, dataset user guides will be <strong>narrative</strong> documents. In the process of advancing a <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Metadata-for-All-Guide-for-Open-Data-Coordinators-1.pdf">similar municipal level initiative</a>, the NYC Open Data Team (with Julia Marden, Tiny Panther Consulting, Sharon Lintz and Jo Polanco) defined dataset user guides as describing “the content of a dataset, how it was created, the agency who maintains it, and how users can begin to use the data.”</p>
<p>This semester your project group will develop a user guide for a federal dataset. Each week you will work through exercises that help apply course concepts from that week to the study of this dataset. Note that you will study the dataset <strong>ethnographically</strong> and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.</p>
<p>Your final user guide may be presented in any format you wish, and I encourage you to be creative. However, the format you choose should be tailored to an audience that you identify in advance.</p>

<ul>
<li>The exercises I provide are <strong>not graded</strong> and <strong>not reviewed by me</strong>; they are meant to frame your research and help you generate material for the project. I will only be formally reviewing your final user guide submission.</li>
<li>Because each group is working on a different dataset, there will likely be components of each exercise that are not relevant to your group; I only expect you to <strong>complete about 70% of each exercise</strong>. Skip the parts that aren’t relevant to you.</li>
<li>You should be meeting with your groups <strong>at least one hour each week</strong> outside of class to coordinate your work and <strong>plan to work an additional hour independently</strong> to make progress towards your research.</li>
<li>The point of this project is not to perform a statistical analysis on this dataset. Instead, you will study the dataset ethnographically and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.</li>
<li>By November, at least part of your group work time should transition from researching the dataset to composing a user guide. Your final submission <strong>should not</strong> be a compilation of text from the exercises you completed. That text was written <em>for you</em>, not for an outside audience. Part of the goal of this project is to be able to translate your research into information that is accessible to an audience.</li>

<section id="community-labor" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="community-labor">Community Labor</h2>
<p>Ethnography is at its best when it involves collaborative inquiry and interpretation. Because of this, I want to encourage us to foster a cooperative community in our classroom. Ethnographers know that building and sustaining strong communities are important and often invisible forms of labor. In an effort to foreground and reward that labor, I’ve built opportunities to contribute to the course community into our grading contract. There are four opportunities for earning community labor points in this course. <em>It will be your responsibility to keep track of your community labor via our course labor log.</em></p>
<section id="contributing-on-slack" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contributing-on-slack">Contributing on Slack</h3>
<p>The first opportunity for earning community labor points is through posting in the <code>#sds-237-discussions</code> Slack channel. For every conversation that you initiate in this channel, you will earn 1 community labor point. For every conversation that you respond to in this channel with substantive summary, critique, or reflection, you will earn 1 community labor point. Finally, for every question that you ask or answer in the <code>#sds-237-questions</code> channel, you will earn 1 community labor point.</p>

</section>
<section id="participating-in-peer-review-workshops" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participating-in-peer-review-workshops">Participating in Peer Review Workshops</h3>
<p>Throughout the semester, I will set up workshops where students may submit their written work for peer review in preparation for assignment submissions. Each peer review workshop that you participate in will count for 2 community labor points.</p>
</section>
<section id="contributing-class-notes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contributing-class-notes">Contributing Class Notes</h3>
<p>Following a class period, up to two students may type up a 1-page outline of what was covered in that class period and post a link to that outline in <code>#sds-237-class-notes</code>. You can sign-up to serve as the notetaker for a certain class <a href="https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/scheduler/view.php?id=1002501">here</a>. These notes should be a full, single-space page, and should make sense to someone that was not present in class. Each class note outline that you contribute will count for 2 community labor points.</p>
<p>Note that throughout the semester, I may offer additional opportunities to earn community labor points as unexpected forms of course labor arise.</p>

<section id="advanced-lead-a-class-reading-discussion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="advanced-lead-a-class-reading-discussion">Advanced: Lead a Class Reading Discussion</h2>
<p>Leading a class reading discussion is one way to demonstrate advanced level work. Reading discussions should be 15 minutes <strong>maximum</strong>. Because we have other activities planned, I will need to cut off discussions if they go too long. Students leading a discussion should start by taking 2-3 minutes to summarize the main arguments of the reading, dicussing how the author supports those arguments. After this, it is up to the student(s) presenting how they wish to structure the remaining time. I’ve had students pose discussion questions to the whole class. I’ve also had students pose questions for small groups to discuss first (note that if you take this option, there is really only time to discuss <strong>at most 2 questions</strong>; trust me, the time goes by fast). I’ve also had students do more experimental things like create Kahoots or present case studies for the class to think through. It’s up to you! Just get us reflecting on the reading! Often students create slides to help structure the discussion, but this is not necessarily a requirement.</p>
