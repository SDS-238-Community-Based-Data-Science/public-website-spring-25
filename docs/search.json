    "text": "This course introduces concepts in human-centered design and design justice, considering how their principles can be applied in the context of community-based data science work. Students will learn how to define social problems, engage stakeholders, design data science solutions, and evaluate social impact. Students will also learn techniques in collaborative data science project planning and execution, engaging best practices (e.g. version control and code review) in the context of a community-based data science project. Strategies for effectively communicating project approach, outcomes, and impact will be addressed throughout the course.\nSDS 192 OR CCX 120: Intro to Data Science or CCX intro are prerequisites for this course.\nUpon completion of this course, you should be able to:\n\nTranslate needs from stakeholders into data science tasks and products\n\nDivide large tasks into subtasks and estimate the amount of time necessary to complete them\nOrganize work within an existing software development framework\nNavigate collaborative work effectively, addressing and leveraging challenges that come up within diverse groups\nContribute code and/or text to a collaborative data science project using a version control system\nCommunicate complex data science concepts and professional ethical standards of practice to stakeholders\nEvaluate the interests and influences of stakeholders within their communities\nApply ethical principles in the context of a real-world problem\nProvide constructive feedback to peers about their programming, writing, and collaborative engagement\n\nClasses will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:50 AM to 12:10 PM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Poirier, she/her/hers.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a cultural anthropologist that studies how civic data gets produced, how communities think about and interface with data, and how data infrastructure can be designed more equitably. My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to predominantly involve group activities and live problem-solving exercises.\n\n\n\nSlackMeeting with Me\n\n\nI can best support students in this course when I can readily keep tabs on our course-related communication. Because of this, I ask that you please don’t email me regarding course-related questions or issues. The best way to get in touch with me is via our course Slack. If you have course-related questions, I encourage you to ask them in the #sds-238-questions channel. When discretion is needed, feel free to DM. Please reserve more formal concerns like grades or accommodation requests for an in-person (or in-person virtual) conversation.\nDuring the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within 24 hours of receiving them. Please note that to maintain my own work-life balance, I don’t answer Slack messages late in the evenings or on the weekends. It’s important that you plan when you start your assignments accordingly.\n\n\nMeeting with me outside of class is a great opportunity for us to chat about what you’re learning in the course, clarify expectations on assignments, and review work in progress. I also love when students drop in to office hours to request book recommendations, discuss career or research paths, or just to say hi!\nThere are two ways to meet with me. If you would like to have a one-on-one private conversation, I ask that you schedule an appointment with me via the booking form on Moodle. For support on class topics, you may drop-in during my regularly scheduled office hours.\n\nMonday, 3:00PM-4:00PM, McConnell 214\nWednesday, 2:00PM-3:00PM, McConnell 214\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCostanza-Chock, Sasha (2020). Design justice: community-led practices to build the worlds we need. Information policy. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. ISBN: 9780262043458.\nThis textbook is available Open Access online. All texts will be made available via our course Perusall.\n\n\n\nThis course will be graded via collaborative assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacobson Center\n\n\n\nSmith’s Jacobson Center asserts that all students can improve their communication and learning skills. I encourage all students to take advantage of their writing support services, workshops, and tutors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparationAttendanceExtensionsAcademic HonestyGenerative AI\n\n\nThis is a 4-credit course with 3 hours per week of in-classroom instructions. Smith expects students to devote 9 out-of-class hours per week to 4-credit classes. I have designed the course assignments and selected the course readings with this target in mind.\n\n\nAttendance in this course is critical as we will use class time to keep projects moving forward. Attendance will be taken each class period. That said, we all have reasons we can’t be available from time-to-time. You may miss three classes with no penalty. You do not need to inform me that you will be absent in these cases, but you should let your group members know. After the third unexcused absence, your final grade may drop by 5 points for each class missed. I understand that you may need to be absent beyond these three sessions. Additional absences may be excused due to family/personal difficulties, sickness, or school or career-related activities; however, I will require some form of documentation for these absences. Please speak with your class dean or the Accessibility Resource Center so that we can get documentation of your need.\nI also ask that you make every effort to arrive to class on time. This is a large course, and when students arrive late, it can be distracting for me as the instructor, and it can be distracting to other students in the course. It also makes it difficult for me to plan group activities. Students arriving more than 10 minutes late for class without having informed me ahead of time will be marked as absent.\nIf you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed. Please note that the SDS Program has adopted a shared policy regarding in-person attendance:\n\nIn keeping with Smith’s core identity and mission as an in-person, residential college, SDS affirms College policy (as per the Provost and Dean of the College) that students will attend class in person. SDS courses will not provide options for remote attendance. Students who have been determined to require a remote attendance accommodation by the Accessibility Resource Center will be the only exceptions to this policy. As with any other kind of ADA accommodations, please notify your instructor during the first week of classes to discuss how we can meet your accommodations.\n\n\n\nIn this course, we are accountable to an external partner. Delivering a final product in 15 weeks demands that we are all coordinated in the completion of components of that product. My extension policy reflects this.\nFor individual assignments. There is a 24-hour grace period on all individual written assignments. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any individual written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, individual late assignments will not receive credit.\nFor group assignments. Submitting a group assignment late could mean that your group cannot participate in class that day. It could also mean that another group will be unable to start their next steps. With this in mind, I will grant extensions for group assignments only in extenuating circumstances. A representative from your group should reach out to me on Slack to request this. A group will not receive credit for late assignments, unless they have coordinated an extension deadline with me ahead of time\nFor reading assignments. We will discuss readings in class, so it is important that you have read them before class. Reading assignments/Perusall annotations need to be completed by the due date for credit.\n\n\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as chatGPT\n\n\n\nThe use of generative artificial intelligence tools is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in a number of domains of work. Despite the urge to push forward with this innovative technology, there are both pedagogical and social reasons that I do not allow students to use generative AI in the context of this course.\nThis course aims to facilitate the development of your ability to think critically, develop creative solutions, and express your ideas with care. The depth of your learning in this course cannot be assessed if Generative AI is aiding or doing this work for you.\nFurther, there are countless unresolved social concerns that stem from the use of generative AI - from the loss of cultural heritage, to the limiting of human aspirations and viewpoints, to the lack of formal mechanisms for regulating its potential social harms. Generative AI models often undermine scholarly values of credit by training on data harvested from across the internet that content creators have not provided express permission to use for these purposes. As an example, several academic journal articles that I have written were recently sold to Microsoft AI; I did not have an opportunity to opt out of this, and I will not receive any compensation for my contributions. Copyright laws have not been able to keep pace with the technology.\nAccordingly, any use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism. I will monitor for use of Generative AI by reviewing the version history of your Google Documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of ConductPrinciples of CommunityPronouns\n\n\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack.\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nI hope that we can foster a collaborative and caring environment in this classroom: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities. Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. “What three words describe how you’re feeling?” “Name one challenge and one success from this week.” “What are you doing for self-care right now?” Thank each other for sharing where they’re at.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge that there is much we don’t know about how our colleagues experience the world. …but don’t ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of.\nCheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.\nAsk questions often in our #sds-238-questions channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nMistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on.\n\n\n\nUsing the proper pronouns for our students is foundational to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a culture of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodationsStudent Well-beingTrigger Warnings\n\n\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center. I can point you to these resources at any time throughout the semester.\n\n\nA trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I can’t always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I’ve set up an anonymous form, available on Moodle, where you can indicate topics for which you would like me to provide a warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoodlePerusallGoogle DriveSlack\n\n\nGrades, forms, and handouts will be available on the course Moodle.\n\n\nAll course readings and recorded lectures will be available on Perusall. You can access Perusall via our course Moodle page.\n\n\nThis semester, you will submit all of your written assignments in a Google Drive folder that you will create on the first day of class. You must write your assignments in Google Docs, as I will sometimes use the commenting features in Google docs when grading your work, and I will monitor the version history for plargiarism.\n\n\nOutside of class almost all of our communication will happen via Slack. You can use the following channels\n\n#general: Course announcements (only I can post)\n#sds-238-discussion: Share news articles and relevant opportunities\n#sds-238-questions: Ask and answer questions about our course\nYou can also create private Slack channels with your project group members."

    "text": "Field Notes\nEthnographers keep field journals to thickly document what they observe in social environments. Typically field notes will describe a physical environment and the participants in that environment (including appearances, roles, behaviors, moods, interactions, conversations, etc.). Field notes will also interpret what was observed, considering how the empirical material affirms, contests, or transforms how we understand cultural phenomena. In data ethnography, the social environment under consideration can be anywhere data is produced, applied, presented, or talked about. This assignment is about paying attention to the numbers (and other forms of data) that inhabit daily life and practicing cultural interpretation.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nRecall, define, explain, apply, and synthesize course concepts and ideas\nEngage the genre and practice of thick description\nDevelop observational habits in data-saturated environments\nDevelop skill in interpreting cultural meaning\n\n\n\nInstructions\nConsider a statistic, dataset, data standard, data infrastructure, or data collection environment that you encountered in the past two weeks. Write 300-400 words, first, detailing the environment and, second, responding to one of the following prompts.\n\nWhat cultural assumptions about what knowledge is and how knowledge is produced can you glean from this data environment?\nHow do binary oppositions structure discourse about data in this environment? With what consequences?\nWhat metaphors are used to characterize data in this environment, and what assumptions about data are conveyed through these metaphors?\nWhat is one master narrative architecturally designed into this data infrastructure? How does that narrative manifest both semiotically and materially through the data infrastructure?\nWhat invisible forms of labor sustain this data infrastructure or data environment? How do the individuals that engage in that labor approach and care for their work? What social forces render that work invisible?\nHow is data science defined in this space? Through what kinds of boundary work do social groups advocate for what should count as legitimate data science? What are the social consequences of this definitional work?\nWhat counts as credible data expertise in this data environment? How do these ideas mediate who gets a voice in the data environment?\nIn what ways are data practices embodied in this environment? How does attention to embodied practice change the ways we understand the data?\nWhat rituals do data collectors engage in this data environment? What shared beliefs motivate these rituals, and how do the rituals manifest in the “raw” data that gets produced?\nWhat stakes do individuals have in how numbers in this data environment get reported? How do social or financial incentives to have the numbers meet or beat certain thresholds animate how individuals behave and the choices they make in relation to this data collection practice, data analysis, or data reporting? Why do those incentives exist?\nHow is the meaning of this statistic or data value socially debated, negotiated, or settled upon?

    "text": "Mini-Projects + Substantive Revision\nThe course mini-projects will provide you with opportunities to practice ethnographic research and cultural analysis. Mini-projects are the predominant way that you will practice the Data Ethnography Methods learning dimension in this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease note that you may complete the mini-projects independently or in a pair. If you choose to complete the project as a pair, both students must participate in data collection, analysis, and writing. Be prepared to submit a short paragraph describing the breakdown of labor, along with your write-up.\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nIdentify, implement, and critique data ethnography research methods\nDevelop observational habits in data-saturated environments\nDevelop skill in analyzing social forces and systems\nPlan and execute a substantive writing revision, while evaluating feedback\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\nInfrastructural Analysis (MP 1)Discourse Analysis (MP 1)Interview (MP 2)Participant Observation (MP 2)\n\n\nFor this assignment, you will select a standard classification system that supports a dataset or system. You will then investigate that information infrastructure through a socio-cultural lens, aiming to respond to the question: What is a cultural assumption embedded in this classification system that goes on to shape the social outcomes of the data it supports? You may briefly research the history of changes to the infrastructure; however, this assignment is not a literature review, and you should limit your use of secondary sources to support your arguments. This paper should represent your cultural analysis of this dataset, not that of others. To do so, you should closely examine the structure of the classification system, using the Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet.\n\nSelecting a data infrastructure\nBefore you select an infrastructure, you should identify a public dataset that organizes information into a series categories\nExamples of classification systems that I’ve seen referenced in public datasets include:\n\nStandard Industrial Classification System (SIC) or the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)\nCarnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education\nBISAC Subject Headings List\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)\nUniform Crime Reporting crime classifications\nAssociation of Computing Machinery (ACM) Computing Classification System\nCandid’s Philanthropy Classification System (PCS)\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the data infrastructure\nTo analyze this infrastructure, you should complete the Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet, which you will submit along with the final write-up. You should aim to answer most of the questions in this worksheet, but you do not need to answer all of them. To answer these questions, you can rely on a diverse range of resources. First and foremost, you should browse the classification system itself, noting how concepts are organized. However, to answer the questions in the worksheet, you may also need to review the websites of the organizations that created/steward the classification, review changelogs that identify changes to the classification, and conduct research to find journal articles, news articles, blog posts, or other grey literature, discussing the classification.Finally, you should consider how everything you learned shaped the way values are presented in the dataset where you originally identified this infrastructure.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo presenting an an answer to the question: What is a cultural assumption embedded in this classification system that goes on to shape the social outcomes of the data it supports? I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. You should engage thick description as you detail the structure and organization of the infrastructure and interpret its symbolic meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nI want to emphasize that this is not a literature review, and you should not approach this assignment simply by regurgitating what you learn in sources you find. Instead, you should focus on analyzing the ways in which the infrastructure both enables and delimits knowledge production by closely studying how its component parts are organized and how they impact your dataset, along with which stakeholder groups advocated for certain changes. The sources you find should serve to provide context for the points that you make. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent submits a mostly complete Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet.\nStudent writes a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting the data infrastructure. All sources are properly cited in the write-up.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment, you have two options: you can 1) watch 1 video (at least 45 minutes long) of a talk about data delivered by a data scientist, or 2) three TED talks (at least 15 minutes each) about data. Please confirm your selection with me ahead of time by DM’ing me on Slack.\n\nAnalyzing the talks\nFollowing the framework in the Discourse Analysis Worksheet, you should examine how data is talked about in the video(s). Consider the epistemologies vocalized, the binary oppositions that structure the language, the rhetorical strategies used, and what this tells us about data culture. You should take detailed notes by responding to several sections within the worksheet. As “data” to back up claims regarding what you notice about the discourse, you should transcribe a series of quotes from the talks. You can add these quotes directly to the worksheet. You will submit the worksheet with your final write-up.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo detailing an argument about the data discourse conveyed in the talk(s). What cultural assumptions about (choose one): 1) what data is, 2) data’s relationship with truth, or 3) what makes data good vs. bad … are reflected in discourse about data? I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. Direct quotations should be referenced throughout (and cited) to back up your claims, but do not count towards the overall word count. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you choose to watch three TED Talks, please note that you should still only present one argument, synthesizing what you learn across all three videos. This means that you should compare discourse across multiple talks in each paragraph. Assignments that present three distinct discourse analyses/do not offer in-paragraph synthesis and comparison will not receive full credit.\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent submits the Discourse Analysis Worksheet with several sections completed.\nStudent writes a 750-1000 word memo detailing the discourse of the talk(s). Direct quotations are included as evidence, and not included in the overall word count.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph. If analyzing multiple talks, student offers comparison and synthesis in each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment you will conduct a 30-minute Zoom interview with an individual for whom data figures centrally in their work. The goal of your interview will be to deepen understanding of the cultures of data work.\n\nIdentifying a data professional, scheduling an interview, and obtaining consent\nIf you choose this assignment, it will be your responsibility to identify a data professional, reach out to them (cc’ing me), and coordinate an interview time well in advance of the project due date. There is a template for emailing an individual provided here, along with a consent form the person you interview should sign. Keep in mind that, while your SDS professors may be an obvious first choice, they cannot support interviews with all of the students in our course. I encourage you to think expansively about who you might interview. I’m happy to offer suggestions on identifying an appropriate person in office hours.\n\n\nPreparing for the interview\nYour interview should address the question: How does the interviewee define the boundaries of data science? How do they define/what do they consider legitimate data science expertise? Write up 10 open-ended questions in preparation for the interview that aim to unpack this theme. You should submit these 10 interview questions along with your memo in your Google Drive.\n\n\nDuring the interview\nAsk the interviewee if they are comfortable with you recording the conversation. You may record with their express permission. If they do not agree to recording, you should be prepared to take notes during the interview.\n\n\nAnalyzing the interview\nYou may wish to use this worksheet to help you with your analysis. However, you are not required to submit this worksheet with your memo.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your interview, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting what was discussed throughout the conversation. Your write-up should address the prompt: How does the interviewee define the boundaries of data science? How do they define/what do they consider legitimate data science expertise? I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent writes/submits 10 relevant interview questions developed in preparation for the interview.\nStudent writes/submits a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting what was discussed in the interview.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment, you will observe a setting in which data figures centrally. You may choose to observe a class engaging in some form of data collection, a hack-a-thon, or even a friend working on a coding assignment for a data science course. The only data setting that I discourage for this assignment is talks that are being presented on-line. These are better suited for the discourse analysis mini-project. As you observe, you will be aiming to gather data that addresses one of the following two questions: 1) How are data practices embodied in this data environment, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data? OR 2) What rituals are engaged in this data, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data?\n\nBefore the Event\nPrior to your observation, you need to obtain permission to observe. If you are observing a class, you should get permission from the instructor. If you are observing an event, you should get permission from the organizer. …if a lab, get permission from the lab manager or faculty director, etc. Be sure to cc me when you email to obtain permission. You may use this email template when obtaining permission.\n\n\nDuring the Observation\nThroughout the event you should take extensive field notes (at least 6 double-spaced, typed pages) about the physical environment of the event, how people behave and interact, how people talk about and data, the rituals they perform, the infrastructures they engage, and more generally how data figures into the social setting. You may talk to individuals in the environment to ask clarifying question, but if you do, you should disclose that you are an ethnographer studying the space.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Observation\nYou may wish to use this worksheet to help you with your analysis. However, you are not required to submit this worksheet with your memo.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your observation, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo describing the event and offering a qualitative interpretive analysis responding to either 1) How are data practices embodied in this data environment, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data? OR 2) What rituals are engaged in this data, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data?. I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent submits the equivalent of about 6 double-spaced typed pages of field notes taken during the event.\nStudent writes/submits a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting the event.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevision\nAfter receiving feedback from me on both submissions, you will have an opportunity to revise one of your submissions. This assignment has three steps:\n\nRead this document on creating a revision plan.\nComplete the Revision Plan worksheet.\nRevise your submission in the same document you had previously been working in based on what you outlined in your revision plan.\n\n\nRemember that grammar, spelling, and punctuation concerns should not be included in a revision plan. Those concerns are addressed in a proofreading stage, not a revising stage.\n\n\n\nResources\n\nMemo template is here\nExample Mini-Project 1 are here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDue to IRB restrictions, I cannot provide examples of past Mini-Project 2 assignments. If you are struggling to figure out how to compose the write-up, please plan to visit office hours."

    "section": "Final Project",
    "text": "Final Project\nIn May 2009, Data.gov - a web portal for accessing US government datasets - was launched by then federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra. Following this, in December 2009, then US President Barack Obama signed the Open Government Data Directive, requiring that all federal agencies post at least 3 high value datasets on data.gov within 45 day. A few years later in May 2013, Pres. Obama signed an Executive Order to: “Mak[e] Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information.”\nThe Order required that the US Office of Management and Budgeting, in collaboration with the CIO and CTO, put out and oversee an Open Data Policy. This policy required the following:\n\nData needs to be published in machine-readable formats\nData needs to be licensed openly\nData needs to be described with metadata.\n\n\nPrompt\nFor this assignment, I would like you to imagine that the Data.gov Program Management Office in US General Services Administration Technology Transformation Services, the Office of Government and Information Services (OGIS), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are jointly championing a new initiative to improve the accessibility of open government metadata. Administrative metadata describing how datasets are managed or stewarded gets published with most open government datasets. Similarly, descriptive metadata gets published in the form of data dictionaries that provide official definitions of observations and variables present in the dataset. However, user-friendly descriptions of how the dataset was produced, how standard definitions were chosen, how categories were divided, how measurements get taken, what assumptions and judgments are built into the data, why certain information may be missing, and where and how the data gets referenced is often harder to come by and rarely published in a succinct format accessible to diverse users.\nTo help advance this initiative, imagine the offices will be contracting with a number of teams of consultants to develop a series of dataset user guides. Unlike many existing metadata formats, dataset user guides will be narrative documents. In the process of advancing a similar municipal level initiative, the NYC Open Data Team (with Julia Marden, Tiny Panther Consulting, Sharon Lintz and Jo Polanco) defined dataset user guides as describing “the content of a dataset, how it was created, the agency who maintains it, and how users can begin to use the data.”\nThis semester your project group will develop a user guide for a federal dataset. Each week you will work through exercises that help apply course concepts from that week to the study of this dataset. Note that you will study the dataset ethnographically and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.\nYour final user guide may be presented in any format you wish, and I encourage you to be creative. However, the format you choose should be tailored to an audience that you identify in advance.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nApply the course concepts in studying the provenance of a dataset\nDevelop skill in analyzing social forces and systems\nProduce effective and descriptive data documentation that puts data in context\nPlan and execute a substantive writing revision, while evaluating feedback\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nGroup Contract\nSemiotic Analysis\nPeopling the Data\nData Collection Rituals\nInstitutional Incentives\nDiscourse Analysis\n\n\n\nAssignment Expectations\n\nThe exercises I provide are not graded and not reviewed by me; they are meant to frame your research and help you generate material for the project. I will only be formally reviewing your final user guide submission.\nBecause each group is working on a different dataset, there will likely be components of each exercise that are not relevant to your group; I only expect you to complete about 70% of each exercise. Skip the parts that aren’t relevant to you.\nYou should be meeting with your groups at least one hour each week outside of class to coordinate your work and plan to work an additional hour independently to make progress towards your research.\nThe point of this project is not to perform a statistical analysis on this dataset. Instead, you will study the dataset ethnographically and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.\nBy November, at least part of your group work time should transition from researching the dataset to composing a user guide. Your final submission should not be a compilation of text from the exercises you completed. That text was written for you, not for an outside audience. Part of the goal of this project is to be able to translate your research into information that is accessible to an audience.\n\n\n\nProject Resources\n\nExample User Guide\n\n\n\nCriteria for Completion\n\nStudent team submits a completed group contract, first draft, and final project draft on time.\nStudent team generates a user guide that demonstrates having completed substantial research across all five project exercises.\nStudent team generates a user guide with language, visuals, and formats tailored towards a particular audience."

    "section": "Community Labor",
    "text": "Community Labor\nEthnography is at its best when it involves collaborative inquiry and interpretation. Because of this, I want to encourage us to foster a cooperative community in our classroom. Ethnographers know that building and sustaining strong communities are important and often invisible forms of labor. In an effort to foreground and reward that labor, I’ve built opportunities to contribute to the course community into our grading contract. There are four opportunities for earning community labor points in this course. It will be your responsibility to keep track of your community labor via our course labor log.\n\nContributing on Slack\nThe first opportunity for earning community labor points is through posting in the #sds-237-discussions Slack channel. For every conversation that you initiate in this channel, you will earn 1 community labor point. For every conversation that you respond to in this channel with substantive summary, critique, or reflection, you will earn 1 community labor point. Finally, for every question that you ask or answer in the #sds-237-questions channel, you will earn 1 community labor point.\n\n\nCompleting Group Evaluations\nMid-way through the semester you will have an opportunity to evaluate your own contributions to your group work, along with that of your peers. Completing group evaluations will count for 1 community labor point.\n\n\nParticipating in Peer Review Workshops\nThroughout the semester, I will set up workshops where students may submit their written work for peer review in preparation for assignment submissions. Each peer review workshop that you participate in will count for 2 community labor points.\n\n\nContributing Class Notes\nFollowing a class period, up to two students may type up a 1-page outline of what was covered in that class period and post a link to that outline in #sds-237-class-notes. You can sign-up to serve as the notetaker for a certain class here. These notes should be a full, single-space page, and should make sense to someone that was not present in class. Each class note outline that you contribute will count for 2 community labor points.\nNote that throughout the semester, I may offer additional opportunities to earn community labor points as unexpected forms of course labor arise."

Students leading a discussion should start by taking 2-3 minutes to summarize the main arguments of the reading, dicussing how the author supports those arguments. After this, it is up to the student(s) presenting how they wish to structure the remaining time. I’ve had students pose discussion questions to the whole class. I’ve also had students pose questions for small groups to discuss first (note that if you take this option, there is really only time to discuss at most 2 questions; trust me, the time goes by fast). I’ve also had students do more experimental things like create Kahoots or present case studies for the class to think through. It’s up to you! Just get us reflecting on the reading! Often students create slides to help structure the discussion, but this is not necessarily a requirement."

How did you engage in independent learning to figure out how to tackle that task? What resources did you engage? What was it like to acquire that knowledge and skill independently? Were there frustrations or celebrations along the way? Are there ways that you’d like to take better advantage of support resources available to you in the future? There is no required format for this write-up; it may be written like a journal entry.

    "text": "Introduction\nThere are many reasons that Git and GitHub are essential infrastructures for collaborative coding projects. For one Git saves snapshots of a code repository at different stages of a project so that we can track how it has changed over time and revert back to an older version if we discover a more recent error. We call this version control. Certain Git features also facilitate many people working on a coding project at once, by providing a number of tools to help prevent collaborators from over-writing each other’s work. These features also make it possible for developers to simultaneously modify, extend, and test components of the code without jeopardizing the project’s current functionality. I use GitHub for assignment submission in some of my courses because it offers a number of features for commenting on and making suggestions in your code, which is super helpful when reviewing group projects. Further, GitHub supports code publication; by publishing code on GitHub, you contribute to an open access/free software community, enabling others to learn from and build off of your work.\nDespite all of these awesome benefits, there can be a significant learning curve when getting started with Git and GitHub. There are new vocabularies, workflows, and error mitigation strategies to learn when getting started. This lab is designed to help you get acquainted with the concepts behind Git and GitHub, suggested workflows for collaborating on projects in this course, and error resolution strategies.\n\nLearning Goals\n\nCreate, update, and close issues\nBranch a repo\nIssue pull requests\nAddress common push/pull errors\nAddress merge conflicts"

    "section": "GitHub Flow",
    "text": "GitHub Flow\n\ngit vs. GitHub.com\ngit is a series of commands available in our computers to save snapshots of files at different moments in time. On the other hand, GitHub.com is a website where we can store projects that have been configured with git commands. You all are collaborators on our class repository at GitHub.com. If you navigate to GitHub.com right now, you will see that repository along with a history of changes students in our class have made to it. However, when you created projects for each of these repositories in RStudio, you were using git commands on your computer to copy the project from GitHub.com to your computer. Similarly, you were using git commands when you staged, committed, and pushed your changes back to GitHub.com. In sum, git is a series of command line tools to manage changes to files. GitHub.com is a Web hosting platform for storing git projects.\n\n\nRemote vs. Local\nWe can store, edit, and publish files on GitHub.com without ever copying them to our local computers. Files at GitHub.com are technically stored on a server somewhere, so we will refer to the projects stored at GitHub.com as remote (i.e. distant, far-off, etc). Similarly, we can use git commands to save snapshots of different versions of files on our local computers without ever pushing the changes to GitHub.com, so we will refer to the projects stored on on our computers as local. In this course, we need the ability to move changes to files between our local and remote repositories.\nWhy can’t we just do everything at GitHub.com or everything on our local machines?? Well GitHub.com doesn’t have the nice environment for writing and running code that you have in RStudio, so we need to be able to move things to your local computers so that you can work on the code in RStudio. On the other hand, if all the work was done on your local computer and never pushed to GitHub.com, your classmates and I would never see it! So the first important consideration in the GitHub Flow is how do we move changes made on our local machines to GitHub.com and vice versa.\nThe great news is that you’ve already been doing this! The primary way that we move changes between remote and local is through two git commands: pull and push. Pull copies changes from a remote repository to our local machines. Push pushes changes from our local machines to a remote repository. It looks like this:\n\nTypically, we want to make sure that we always follow this flow:\n\nPull changes from GitHub.com (remote) to local.\nMake changes locally,\nPush changes to GitHub.com.\n\nAs we are going to see later in the lab, the most frustrating issues with GitHub emerge when we break this flow.\n\n\nTo Branch or Not to Branch?\nIn my opinion, there are two kinds of workflows for GitHub. There’s the quick and dirty version, and there’s the long and elegant version. We just went over the Quick and Dirty version, and you’ve already had practice in it when submitting all of your labs for the course. Below are the differences between these two workflows (don’t worry about if you don’t understand what the steps mean right now; we will learn all of them in the lab).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick and Dirty Version\nLong and Elegant Version\n\n\n\n\n\nPull recent changes from GitHub to local machine.\nMake edits and save them\nStage and commit changes.\nPush changes from local machine to GitHub.\n\nIn the quick and dirty version, all of this occurs in the main branch.\n\nCreate an issue at GitHub.com\nBranch the repo at GitHub.com.\nPull recent changes from GitHub.com to local machine.\nMake edits in the new branch and save them.\nStage and commit changes.\nPush changes from local machine to GitHub.com.\nCreate a pull request at GitHub.com\nAssign a reviewer to review the proposed changes and wait for their approval.\nMerge changes, while also closing the issue and deleting the branch.\n\n\n\n\nTypically I recommend the long and elegant version for group work as it is designed to avoid errors and ensure that collaborators are all on the same page regarding changes to files. However, occasionally when you have to make small, quick changes to a file, and it won’t impact your teammate’s work, it will make more sense to follow the quick and dirty workflow. The goal for today is to get practice in the long and elegant version.\n\n\nRepo\n\nQuestion\n\nNavigate to GitHub Classroom to accept the assignment. For this assignment, you will work in teams of 3 at most. Enter the team name assigned to you in the spreadsheet I posted in Slack this morning. Everyone in the group should enter the same team name.\n\n\n\nThis will create a repository at GitHub.com called github-practice. Navigate to the URL that appears when you accept the assignment. You’ll notice that the repository has a few files - README.md, github-practice.Rmd, .gitingore. You’ll also notice in the repo’s right sidebar that your group members are listed as collaborators. This means that you all have access to read and write to this repository.\n\n\n\n\nClone\nCloning is a git command that copies a remote repository to your local machine. In other words, it will copy all of the project files in the remote GitHub.com folder to your local computer.\n\nQuestion\n\nAll group members should clone the repo to their RStudio environment. To do so, copy the repo’s URL at GitHub.com. You will want to make sure you are in the main project folder when you copy this URL; it won’t work if you’ve clicked through to any of the files. Then in RStudio click on File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git, and paste the copied URL into the window that appears. Note what you see in the RStudio files pane after cloning the repo.\n\n\n\nRemember that cloning creates a copy of a remote repo on a local machine. In creating this project, you’ve copied all of the files that make up the github-practice repo at GitHub.com to your local computer. This means that you will find all of the files associated with this repo by navigating to the folder where you created the project on your computer.\nIt’s important to note that this is not just any old folder on your computer though. By cloning, you’ve created a git folder. This means that the folder has been set up in a way where git can track the changes that you make to it over time, and it knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with. If you tried to just create a new folder on your computer, it wouldn’t necessarily have these nice features.\n\n\n\n\nIssues\n\nQuestion\n\nNavigate back to GitHub.com, and click on the repo’s Issues tab. Each member of your team should create an issue by clicking the ‘New Issue’ button. Title the issue: “Adding &lt;your name&gt; to the assignment.” Submit the issue, and to the left of the screen, assign the issue to yourself.\n\n\n\n\nIssues support project planning by allowing you to track changes you hope to make to your project over time. By assigning issues to certain collaborators on your project team, you can have clear documentation of who is responsible for what.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn my own projects, I use Issues for a number of purposes. Sometimes I use Issues to document bugs that I notice in my code that need to be fixed. Other times I use them to track features that I would like to add to my code down the road. Oftentimes, in my public repositories, I encourage others that are using my code to submit issues to ask questions about how something works, to report bugs, or to request features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch\nWhen you first create a repository, all of the code will be stored in the main branch of the repository. If you were to think of a project like a tree growing up from the ground, then the main branch would be the like the trunk of the tree. We don’t want the main branch to break because the whole tree could come down. One goal of a branching workflow in GitHub is to keep the most stable and polished versions of code in the main branch.\nSo what do we do in the meantime - when we’re editing code, potentially breaking things, trying to sort out its bugs, and it’s not quite in that stable and polished state yet? That’s where branching comes in.\nWhen we create a branch of our repo, GitHub creates a separate copy of the repo where you can make changes without impacting what’s in the main branch. Later, once we’re done making changes and things are stable and polished, we will have the opportunity to merge those changes back into the main branch.\nThink of it another way: You write a rockstar first draft of a final paper, and you decide to send it to a few friends to review. You could just share the original document with them and tell them “Have at it! Edit away!” The problem is that, if they are making changes directly to the original document, you could lose some of that awesome original text. A better option would be to create separate copies for each teammate to edit, send them those copies, and then figure out how to layer in their edits later. This is like branching. The original document would be the main branch, and each copy sent to a friend would be a branch off of main. Friends can make as many edits as they want in their branch because you still have the original stable and polished copy. Later, we can merge their changes back into the main branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBranching can get pretty wild in GitHub. You can have branches of branches of branches. I don’t recommend this. A good workflow is to create a branch for making specific changes, merge those changes back into main, delete the branch, and then create a new branch for the next batch of changes.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nClick on the Code tab on your repo’s page at GitHub.com. Directly below this tab, you will see a dropdown that is currently labeled “main.” This means that you are in the main branch. Each member of your team should click the down arrow, and create a branch by entering their first name into the textbox that appears, and then clicking “Create branch.”\n\n\n\n\n\nPull\nAs of right now, the branches that were created in the previous step only exist on GitHub.com, they don’t exist yet on your local machine. To get these changes to your local machine, you need to Pull the changes. Remember how we said that the super fancy git folder knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with? When we pull changes to our local machines, we are basically saying, check that remote version for changes, and then pull them into the repo on my computer.\n\nQuestion\n\nHead back to RStudio. In the Environment pane, you will notice a tab labeled “Git.” It’s important to note that this tab will only appear in projects that are built from super fancy git folders. This is your RStudio command center for Git and GitHub. When you click on this tab, you will see a few buttons in the navigation bar. To pull changes, you should click the blue downward arrow. Click this button to pull the branches created remotely to your local machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch Branches\nEven though you pulled the new branches to your local machine, you are still currently working in the main branch. Remember that we always want to keep the main branch stable and polished. This is not where we are going to make edits. Instead, you will make edits in the branch that you just created. Later, we will merge those changes back into the main branch.\n\nQuestion\n\nIn the top right hand corner of the Git tab, you will see a dropdown currently set to “main”. Click the downward arrow, and switch to your branch by selecting the appropriate branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nMake Changes\n\nQuestion\n\nOnce in your branch, open github-practice.Rmd from the files pane. Decide within your group who will be Group member 1, 2, 3, and so on. (If there are only two group members, that’s fine - just assign someone member 1 and the other member 2) Each group member should edit this file on their own local machines by adding their name and only their name to the appropriate location in the document (line 5, 7, or 9) based on their assigned number. It’s very important that this be the only section of the document you edit. Save the file by clicking File&gt;Save.\n\n\n\n\nStage\nSometimes we make a changes to a few files, save them, and we’re ready to create a snapshot of our repo (i.e. create a commit) with some of those changes. Remember that creating this snapshot is almost like taking a photo of the repo at this particular moment, allowing us to later go back to that photo to see what the repo looked like in that moment. To let Git know which changes we want to include in that snapshot, we need to stage the files. Staging basically says, “these files are ready to be included in the snapshot.”\n\nQuestion\n\nOnce you save the file you’ll notice in the RStudio Git pane that the file name appears after a blue square labeled “M” (which stands for Modified). This means that the file is ready for staging. Stage the file - indicating that it’s ready for committing - by clicking the checkbox in front of the file name.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit\nAs we just noted, committing changes basically means taking a snapshot of a repo at a particular moment in time. Commits are given unique hashes - sort of like a unique identifier that enables us to access the snapshot of the repo at a later date. In collaborative projects, it is typically recommended to commit often - after any major changes are made to a file. This ensures that we can eventually go back to look at very specific changes. It’s also important to label commits with descriptive titles so that we can recall what changes within that commit. Descriptive titles should detail what changes were made in the last round of edits.\nTo help put this into context, think back to our photograph metaphor. Let’s say that we are a photographer assigned to document how a baby develops in the first year of its life. If the photographer only took one photograph when the baby was 1 year old, we wouldn’t have a lot of documentation regarding how the baby developed! …so instead, let’s say that the photographer took a snapshot of the baby after every major milestone - their first laugh, their first solid food, their first crawl, their first word. We would have a lot more to go by when trying to understand how the baby developed. Same goes for committing code often.\nNow let’s say the photographer handed the batch of photos to the parents, and said - “look, here’s how your baby developed over time.” The parents might not remember which photograph was taken after which milestone. …but if the photographer were to label each photograph with things like “baby had first laugh,” the parents would be able to easily go back to specific moments in their baby’s development. This is why we want descriptive commit messages. We want to later be able to go back and scan through what changes were made after each commit.\nTo get a sense of what it means to be able to look back on these changes, check out the latest commits that we’ve made to our collective project repo. I could click through any of these links to see what my repo looked like at a previous moment in time.\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCommit your changes by clicking the ‘Commit’ button in the Git pane. When you click this button, a new window will open showcasing the changes that have been made to the staged file. You should enter a commit message in the window that appears. Remember that commit messages should be descriptive. In this case, something like “added &lt;your-name&gt;’s name” would work. Click commit. Now a snapshot of this version of the code repo has been taken.\n\n\n\n\nPush\nOnly your local machine knows that a change has been made to the code. Remember again how we said that the super fancy git folder knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with? Now we want to do the opposite of pulling changes from GitHub to our local machines. Instead, we want to push the changes on our local machines to GitHub.\n\nQuestion\n\nClick the Green upward arrow in the Git pane to push your changes to GitHub.\n\nOnce all group members have pushed their changes, head back over to GitHub. On the main code page, switch between branches and check out the contents of github-practice.Rmd in each branch. What differences do you notice?\n\n\n\n\nPull Request\nNote that now we have a few versions of our repo in separate branches on GitHub.com, and in each of those versions of the repo, the github-practice.Rmd file looks a little bit different. Now that we’ve made our changes and things are stable and polished, we want to move all of those changes into the main branch. To do this, we are going to issue a Pull Request. This is a request that signals to all of our collaborators that we are ready to move our changes back into the main branch.\n\nQuestion\n\nOn your repo’s page in GitHub.com, click the “Pull Requests” tab, and then click the green “New Pull Request” button. You’re requesting to pull the changes from your personal branch into the main branch. This means that the base branch should be main, and the compare branch should be your personal branch.\n\nYou’ll see a screen where you can compare your branch to the main branch. Click the button to “Create Pull Request,” enter a descriptive title of the changes made, and then click “Create Pull Request” again.\n\n\n\n\nReview Pull Requests\nI recommend that you get in the habit of reviewing your collaborator’s work before merging their changes into the main branch. By creating pull requests, we scaffold an opportunity to review each other’s work before fully integrating the changes.\nNow there should be a pull request for all members of your team. Assign one team member to review one other team member’s code. All team members should have one reviewer.\n\nQuestion\n\nOpen your own pull request in GitHub.com, and in the right sidebar, assign the team member responsible for reviewing your changes as a “Reviewer.”\n\nThen navigate to the pull request you are responsible for reviewing. Click on the “Files Changed” tab. Note that the left side of the screen shows the previous version of the file, and the right side of the screen shows the new version of the file. Lines in red have been deleted, and lines in green have been added.\n\nAfter looking through the changes, click the green button “Review changes.” Leave a note for your collaborator, indicating your evaluation of their changes. If everything looks good, check the radio button for “Approve.” If there are issues, check the radio button for “Request Changes.” Then click the button to “Submit Review.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf your reviewer requested changes, you should go back to RStudio, and make sure you are in your own branch. Then make the requested changes, save the file, stage the file, commit the changes, and push again. The changes to your file will be tracked in your pull request. After this, you may move on to the Merge step. See here for further options on dismissing or re-requesting reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerge\nOnce all reviewers have approved changes, we are ready to merge those changes into the main branch. Open each pull request. If everything is good and ready to merge, you will see a green checkmark that says “This branch has no conflicts with the base branch.”\n\n(If you get a message that there are conflicts, call the instructor over.)\n\nQuestion\n\nClick the button to “Merge Pull Request”. In the comment box that appears, enter the text “closes #”. When you enter this text, you will see a dropdown of issues and pull requests currently in the repo. Issues will have an icon that appears as a circle with a dot in the center.\n\nSelect the issue associated with this pull request, and then click “Confirm Merge.” This will both merge the changes into the main branch and simultaneously close the issue you opened earlier. Finally, click the button to the delete the branch. Once this has been completed for all pull requests, head back over to the “Code” tab at GitHub.com, and check out github-practice.Rmd. What has happened to the file since merging the code? Navigate to the “Issues” tab. What has happened to the issues since confirming the merge?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore moving on to the next section…\n\n\n\nYou’ve now deleted branches at GitHub.com that your local machines don’t know have been deleted. By default, RStudio does not delete branches locally that have been deleted remotely, even after pulling changes. We can fix this by entering the following line into our Terminals in RStudio:\ngit config --global fetch.prune true\nRestart RStudio, and then pull changes (branch deletions) to your local machine by clicking the blue downward arrow. To streamline things in the next section of the lab, we are going to work entirely in the main branch (something that I would otherwise not recommend)."

    "section": "Error Resolution",
    "text": "Error Resolution\nThe workflow presented above seems to work all fine and dandy. …but there are a number of factors that can impede this seamless workflow. In this final section of the lab, we will go over three kinds of errors that you might come across in the workflow above, and talk about how you would resolve them. I can almost guarantee that you will deal with some of these issues when working on your group projects, so I would encourage you to keep this lab handy when engaging in project work.\n\nPush error\nA push error occurs when we make changes to files on our local machines, and go to commit and push them to GitHub.com, but other changes had already been made to the file at GitHub.com that were not yet pulled into our local environments. We get an error because our local repo is inconsistent with the remote repo. To fix this error, we need to pull changes to our local machine, and try committing and pushing again. Let’s replicate this error:\n\nQuestion\n\nOne of your partners should navigate to the GitHub.com repository. Click on the file README.md. Click the pencil icon to edit the file. Replace the text: ADD NAME 1 HERE ADD NAME 2 HERE, and so on with your names. Scroll to the bottom of the page and commit changes noting in the message that your names were added.\nOther partner: Return to RStudio. Do not pull changes yet. Open github-practice.Rmd. On line 40 change the ncol() function to dim(). Save the file. Stage and commit your changes. Click the green upward arrow to push your changes. You should get an error that looks like this.\n\nFollow the steps above to resolve the error.\n\n\n\nAn easy way to avoid a push error is to always click the blue downward arrow to pull remote changes before starting to edit files on your local machine.\n\n\n\n\nPull error\nA pull error occurs when changes have already been made to the same location (the same line number) in both a remote file and a local file, and then we try to pull the changes from the remote repo to our local machines. As far as Git can tell, there are two options for what this line is supposed to look like, and it can’t tell which to prioritize. So Git recommends that, as a first step, we commit the changes that we made locally. It’s basically saying, let’s take a snapshot of your local repo as it looks right now, so that later we can figure out what to do about this conflict.\nIf this seems confusing imagine this: let’s say you write a paper, and you share it with one of your classmates to review. The classmate reads through it, makes suggested changes to the opening sentence, and sends it back you. …but, while your classmate was reviewing the paper, you were getting antsy about the paper deadline and started making your own edits to the paper, including edits to the opening sentence. Now you’re trying to incorporate the changes from your classmate’s review, and you’re not sure what to do about that opening sentence. As a first step, you have two options you can scrap your recent changes (maybe your classmate’s suggestions were better!) or you can save a separate copy of the file with your recent changes and figure out later how to resolve the differences. That’s exactly what we are going to do here:\nTo fix this error, you should stage and commit your local changes and then try pulling again. Let’s replicate this error:\n\nQuestion\n\nOne of your partners should navigate to the GitHub.com repository. Click on the file github-practice.Rmd. Click the pencil icon to edit the file. Replace the code on line 47 with the following: colnames(pioneer_valley_2013).\nScroll to the bottom of the page and commit changes noting in the message how you updated the function.\nOther partner: Return to RStudio. Do not pull changes yet. Open github-practice.Rmd. Replace the code on line 47 with the following: ncol(pioneer_valley_2013)\nSave the file. Click the blue downward button to Pull changes. You should get an error that looks like this.\n\nFollow the steps above to resolve the error.\n\n\n\n\nMerge conflict\nSo now we have these two snapshots of github-practice.Rmd, and they are in conflict with one another. If we try to push our changes back to GitHub.com, Git is not going to know what to do. Should the file at GitHub.com look like the version currently at GitHub.com, should it look like the snapshot that we just commit to our local machines, or should it look like something else entirely?\nLet’s return to the example of trying to incorporate a peer’s edits to a paper that you have recently made changes to. We have to figure out what to do about that opening sentence. Do we want our version, their version, or some combination of the two? This is what it is like to fix a merge conflict.\nTo fix this error, open the file with conflicts and edit the lines with conflict.\n\nQuestion\n\nOne of your partners should try to pull changes by clicking the blue downward arrow in RStudio. You will get an error that looks like this:\n{fig-alt=“This is the window that we see when we get a merge conflict. It says: CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md}\nTo fix this one your partners should open the file with the conflict. In this case it will be github-practice.Rmd. Scroll to the section of the file with the conflict. It will now look something like this:\n    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\n\n    ncol(pioneer_valley_2013)\n\n    =======\n\n    colnames(pioneer_valley_2013)\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ee175895783b64e0e1f696d9456be4c4c7c3f3bf\nThe code following HEAD represents the recent changes you made on your local machine, and the code right before the long string of characters represents the changes that were made in an earlier commit (the long string of characters is the commit hash). Decide what that line should look like and delete all other content. This means you must delete “&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD”, “=======”, and “&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;long-hash&gt;”, and you likely should delete at least one other line. Save the file, stage the file by clicking the checkbox next to the file in the Git page, and then commit your changes, and push them to GitHub.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding Merge Conflicts\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that the most frustrating merge conflicts tend to emerge when we have two people working on the same line of a repo’s file. The most effective way to avoid merge conflicts is to ensure that collaborators are working on different documents or different lines in a file. One way you might do this when starting to work on your group project is to open a file that you all plan to work on and having one of your team mates section off space of that file for different people to work. It might look something like this:\n\nOnce this change has been made, that group mate should stage, commit, and push the file to GitHub, and all other group mates should pull the change to their local machines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPath of Least Resistance\nI have been working with GitHub for years, and even to this day, I run into instances where things become so inconsistent between my local machine and the repo at GitHub.com that the fastest way to fix things is just to save local copies of the files that I’ve changed to somewhere else on my machine, delete the super fancy Git folder from its current location, and then re-clone the most up-to-date remote version to my local machine. Then I can figure out how I want to edit the most up-to-date version with my changes. This comic from XKCD captures this widely acknowledged solution beautifully:"
