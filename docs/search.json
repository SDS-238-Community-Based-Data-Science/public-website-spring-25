    "text": "This course introduces concepts in human-centered design and design justice, considering how their principles can be applied in the context of community-based data science work. Students will learn how to define social problems, engage stakeholders, design data science solutions, and evaluate social impact. Students will also learn techniques in collaborative data science project planning and execution, engaging best practices (e.g. version control and code review) in the context of a community-based data science project. Strategies for effectively communicating project approach, outcomes, and impact will be addressed throughout the course.\nSDS 192 OR CCX 120: Intro to Data Science or CCX intro are prerequisites for this course.\nUpon completion of this course, you should be able to:\n\nTranslate needs from stakeholders into data science tasks and products\n\nDivide large tasks into subtasks and estimate the amount of time necessary to complete them\nOrganize work within an existing software development framework\nNavigate collaborative work effectively, addressing and leveraging challenges that come up within diverse groups\nContribute code and/or text to a collaborative data science project using a version control system\nCommunicate complex data science concepts and professional ethical standards of practice to stakeholders\nEvaluate the interests and influences of stakeholders within their communities\nApply ethical principles in the context of a real-world problem\nProvide constructive feedback to peers about their programming, writing, and collaborative engagement\n\nClasses will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:50 AM to 12:10 PM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Poirier, she/her/hers.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a cultural anthropologist that studies how civic data gets produced, how communities think about and interface with data, and how data infrastructure can be designed more equitably. My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to predominantly involve group activities and live problem-solving exercises.\n\n\n\nSlackMeeting with Me\n\n\nI can best support students in this course when I can readily keep tabs on our course-related communication. Because of this, I ask that you please don’t email me regarding course-related questions or issues. The best way to get in touch with me is via our course Slack. If you have course-related questions, I encourage you to ask them in the #sds-238-questions channel. When discretion is needed, feel free to DM. Please reserve more formal concerns like grades or accommodation requests for an in-person (or in-person virtual) conversation.\nDuring the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within 24 hours of receiving them. Please note that to maintain my own work-life balance, I don’t answer Slack messages late in the evenings or on the weekends. It’s important that you plan when you start your assignments accordingly.\n\n\nMeeting with me outside of class is a great opportunity for us to chat about what you’re learning in the course, clarify expectations on assignments, and review work in progress. I also love when students drop in to office hours to request book recommendations, discuss career or research paths, or just to say hi!\nThere are two ways to meet with me. If you would like to have a one-on-one private conversation, I ask that you schedule an appointment with me via the booking form on Moodle. For support on class topics, you may drop-in during my regularly scheduled office hours.\n\nMonday, 3:00PM-4:00PM, McConnell 214\nWednesday, 2:00PM-3:00PM, McConnell 214\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCostanza-Chock, Sasha (2020). Design justice: community-led practices to build the worlds we need. Information policy. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. ISBN: 9780262043458.\nThis textbook is available Open Access online. All texts will be made available via our course Perusall.\n\n\n\nThis course will be graded via collaborative assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacobson Center\n\n\n\nSmith’s Jacobson Center asserts that all students can improve their communication and learning skills. I encourage all students to take advantage of their writing support services, workshops, and tutors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparationAttendanceExtensionsAcademic HonestyGenerative AI\n\n\nThis is a 4-credit course with 3 hours per week of in-classroom instructions. Smith expects students to devote 9 out-of-class hours per week to 4-credit classes. I have designed the course assignments and selected the course readings with this target in mind.\n\n\nAttendance in this course is critical as we will use class time to keep projects moving forward. Attendance will be taken each class period. That said, we all have reasons we can’t be available from time-to-time. You may miss three classes with no penalty. You do not need to inform me that you will be absent in these cases, but you should let your group members know. After the third unexcused absence, your final grade may drop by 5 points for each class missed. I understand that you may need to be absent beyond these three sessions. Additional absences may be excused due to family/personal difficulties, sickness, or school or career-related activities; however, I will require some form of documentation for these absences. Please speak with your class dean or the Accessibility Resource Center so that we can get documentation of your need.\nI also ask that you make every effort to arrive to class on time. This is a large course, and when students arrive late, it can be distracting for me as the instructor, and it can be distracting to other students in the course. It also makes it difficult for me to plan group activities. Students arriving more than 10 minutes late for class without having informed me ahead of time will be marked as absent.\nIf you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed. Please note that the SDS Program has adopted a shared policy regarding in-person attendance:\n\nIn keeping with Smith’s core identity and mission as an in-person, residential college, SDS affirms College policy (as per the Provost and Dean of the College) that students will attend class in person. SDS courses will not provide options for remote attendance. Students who have been determined to require a remote attendance accommodation by the Accessibility Resource Center will be the only exceptions to this policy. As with any other kind of ADA accommodations, please notify your instructor during the first week of classes to discuss how we can meet your accommodations.\n\n\n\nIn this course, we are accountable to an external partner. Delivering a final product in 15 weeks demands that we are all coordinated in the completion of components of that product. My extension policy reflects this.\nFor individual assignments. There is a 24-hour grace period on all individual written assignments. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any individual written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, individual late assignments will not receive credit.\nFor group assignments. Submitting a group assignment late could mean that your group cannot participate in class that day. It could also mean that another group will be unable to start their next steps. With this in mind, I will grant extensions for group assignments only in extenuating circumstances. A representative from your group should reach out to me on Slack to request this. A group will not receive credit for late assignments, unless they have coordinated an extension deadline with me ahead of time\nFor reading assignments. We will discuss readings in class, so it is important that you have read them before class. Reading assignments/Perusall annotations need to be completed by the due date for credit.\n\n\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as chatGPT\n\n\n\nThe use of generative artificial intelligence tools is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in a number of domains of work. Despite the urge to push forward with this innovative technology, there are both pedagogical and social reasons that I do not allow students to use generative AI in the context of this course.\nThis course aims to facilitate the development of your ability to think critically, develop creative solutions, and express your ideas with care. The depth of your learning in this course cannot be assessed if Generative AI is aiding or doing this work for you.\nFurther, there are countless unresolved social concerns that stem from the use of generative AI - from the loss of cultural heritage, to the limiting of human aspirations and viewpoints, to the lack of formal mechanisms for regulating its potential social harms. Generative AI models often undermine scholarly values of credit by training on data harvested from across the internet that content creators have not provided express permission to use for these purposes. As an example, several academic journal articles that I have written were recently sold to Microsoft AI; I did not have an opportunity to opt out of this, and I will not receive any compensation for my contributions. Copyright laws have not been able to keep pace with the technology.\nAccordingly, any use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism. I will monitor for use of Generative AI by reviewing the version history of your Google Documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of ConductPrinciples of CommunityPronouns\n\n\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack.\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nI hope that we can foster a collaborative and caring environment in this classroom: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities. Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. “What three words describe how you’re feeling?” “Name one challenge and one success from this week.” “What are you doing for self-care right now?” Thank each other for sharing where they’re at.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge that there is much we don’t know about how our colleagues experience the world. …but don’t ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of.\nCheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.\nAsk questions often in our #sds-238-questions channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nMistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on.\n\n\n\nUsing the proper pronouns for our students is foundational to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a culture of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodationsStudent Well-beingTrigger Warnings\n\n\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center. I can point you to these resources at any time throughout the semester.\n\n\nA trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I can’t always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I’ve set up an anonymous form, available on Moodle, where you can indicate topics for which you would like me to provide a warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoodlePerusallGoogle DriveSlack\n\n\nGrades, forms, and handouts will be available on the course Moodle.\n\n\nAll course readings and recorded lectures will be available on Perusall. You can access Perusall via our course Moodle page.\n\n\nThis semester, you will submit all of your written assignments in a Google Drive folder that you will create on the first day of class. You must write your assignments in Google Docs, as I will sometimes use the commenting features in Google docs when grading your work, and I will monitor the version history for plargiarism.\n\n\nOutside of class almost all of our communication will happen via Slack. You can use the following channels\n\n#general: Course announcements (only I can post)\n#sds-238-discussion: Share news articles and relevant opportunities\n#sds-238-questions: Ask and answer questions about our course\nYou can also create private Slack channels with your project group members."

    "text": "Field Notes\nEthnographers keep field journals to thickly document what they observe in social environments. Typically field notes will describe a physical environment and the participants in that environment (including appearances, roles, behaviors, moods, interactions, conversations, etc.). Field notes will also interpret what was observed, considering how the empirical material affirms, contests, or transforms how we understand cultural phenomena. In data ethnography, the social environment under consideration can be anywhere data is produced, applied, presented, or talked about. This assignment is about paying attention to the numbers (and other forms of data) that inhabit daily life and practicing cultural interpretation.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nRecall, define, explain, apply, and synthesize course concepts and ideas\nEngage the genre and practice of thick description\nDevelop observational habits in data-saturated environments\nDevelop skill in interpreting cultural meaning\n\n\n\nInstructions\nConsider a statistic, dataset, data standard, data infrastructure, or data collection environment that you encountered in the past two weeks. Write 300-400 words, first, detailing the environment and, second, responding to one of the following prompts.\n\nWhat cultural assumptions about what knowledge is and how knowledge is produced can you glean from this data environment?\nHow do binary oppositions structure discourse about data in this environment? With what consequences?\nWhat metaphors are used to characterize data in this environment, and what assumptions about data are conveyed through these metaphors?\nWhat is one master narrative architecturally designed into this data infrastructure? How does that narrative manifest both semiotically and materially through the data infrastructure?\nWhat invisible forms of labor sustain this data infrastructure or data environment? How do the individuals that engage in that labor approach and care for their work? What social forces render that work invisible?\nHow is data science defined in this space? Through what kinds of boundary work do social groups advocate for what should count as legitimate data science? What are the social consequences of this definitional work?\nWhat counts as credible data expertise in this data environment? How do these ideas mediate who gets a voice in the data environment?\nIn what ways are data practices embodied in this environment? How does attention to embodied practice change the ways we understand the data?\nWhat rituals do data collectors engage in this data environment? What shared beliefs motivate these rituals, and how do the rituals manifest in the “raw” data that gets produced?\nWhat stakes do individuals have in how numbers in this data environment get reported? How do social or financial incentives to have the numbers meet or beat certain thresholds animate how individuals behave and the choices they make in relation to this data collection practice, data analysis, or data reporting? Why do those incentives exist?\nHow is the meaning of this statistic or data value socially debated, negotiated, or settled upon? At what thresholds do the data values become actionable, and how do social groups determine levels of actionability? How and under what conditions do these decisions get made?\nHow are data socially mobilized in this space? What strategies do individuals, institutions, or social groups engage to render the data persuasive?\n\n\n\nSample Work\n\nPrevious Student Field Notes here\nHere’s an example of some very short ““thick description”” write-ups of two data environments from my own research.\n\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent writes 300-400 words about a statistic, dataset, data standard, or data collection environment.\nStudent writes about a data situation encountered in the past two weeks.\nStudent responds to a prompt, engaging course concepts to interpret the cultural meaning of the data situation analyzed."

You may briefly research the history of changes to the infrastructure; however, this assignment is not a literature review, and you should limit your use of secondary sources to support your arguments. This paper should represent your cultural analysis of this dataset, not that of others. To do so, you should closely examine the structure of the classification system, using the Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet.\n\nSelecting a data infrastructure\nBefore you select an infrastructure, you should identify a public dataset that organizes information into a series categories\nExamples of classification systems that I’ve seen referenced in public datasets include:\n\nStandard Industrial Classification System (SIC) or the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)\nCarnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education\nBISAC Subject Headings List\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)\nUniform Crime Reporting crime classifications\nAssociation of Computing Machinery (ACM) Computing Classification System\nCandid’s Philanthropy Classification System (PCS)\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the data infrastructure\nTo analyze this infrastructure, you should complete the Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet, which you will submit along with the final write-up. You should aim to answer most of the questions in this worksheet, but you do not need to answer all of them. To answer these questions, you can rely on a diverse range of resources. First and foremost, you should browse the classification system itself, noting how concepts are organized. However, to answer the questions in the worksheet, you may also need to review the websites of the organizations that created/steward the classification, review changelogs that identify changes to the classification, and conduct research to find journal articles, news articles, blog posts, or other grey literature, discussing the classification.Finally, you should consider how everything you learned shaped the way values are presented in the dataset where you originally identified this infrastructure.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo presenting an an answer to the question: What is a cultural assumption embedded in this classification system that goes on to shape the social outcomes of the data it supports? I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. You should engage thick description as you detail the structure and organization of the infrastructure and interpret its symbolic meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nI want to emphasize that this is not a literature review, and you should not approach this assignment simply by regurgitating what you learn in sources you find. Instead, you should focus on analyzing the ways in which the infrastructure both enables and delimits knowledge production by closely studying how its component parts are organized and how they impact your dataset, along with which stakeholder groups advocated for certain changes. The sources you find should serve to provide context for the points that you make. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent submits a mostly complete Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet.\nStudent writes a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting the data infrastructure. All sources are properly cited in the write-up.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment, you have two options: you can 1) watch 1 video (at least 45 minutes long) of a talk about data delivered by a data scientist, or 2) three TED talks (at least 15 minutes each) about data. Please confirm your selection with me ahead of time by DM’ing me on Slack.\n\nAnalyzing the talks\nFollowing the framework in the Discourse Analysis Worksheet, you should examine how data is talked about in the video(s). Consider the epistemologies vocalized, the binary oppositions that structure the language, the rhetorical strategies used, and what this tells us about data culture. You should take detailed notes by responding to several sections within the worksheet. As “data” to back up claims regarding what you notice about the discourse, you should transcribe a series of quotes from the talks. You can add these quotes directly to the worksheet. You will submit the worksheet with your final write-up.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo detailing an argument about the data discourse conveyed in the talk(s). What cultural assumptions about (choose one): 1) what data is, 2) data’s relationship with truth, or 3) what makes data good vs. bad … are reflected in discourse about data? I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. Direct quotations should be referenced throughout (and cited) to back up your claims, but do not count towards the overall word count. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you choose to watch three TED Talks, please note that you should still only present one argument, synthesizing what you learn across all three videos. This means that you should compare discourse across multiple talks in each paragraph. Assignments that present three distinct discourse analyses/do not offer in-paragraph synthesis and comparison will not receive full credit.\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent submits the Discourse Analysis Worksheet with several sections completed.\nStudent writes a 750-1000 word memo detailing the discourse of the talk(s). Direct quotations are included as evidence, and not included in the overall word count.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph. If analyzing multiple talks, student offers comparison and synthesis in each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment you will conduct a 30-minute Zoom interview with an individual for whom data figures centrally in their work. The goal of your interview will be to deepen understanding of the cultures of data work.\n\nIdentifying a data professional, scheduling an interview, and obtaining consent\nIf you choose this assignment, it will be your responsibility to identify a data professional, reach out to them (cc’ing me), and coordinate an interview time well in advance of the project due date. There is a template for emailing an individual provided here, along with a consent form the person you interview should sign. Keep in mind that, while your SDS professors may be an obvious first choice, they cannot support interviews with all of the students in our course. I encourage you to think expansively about who you might interview. I’m happy to offer suggestions on identifying an appropriate person in office hours.\n\n\nPreparing for the interview\nYour interview should address the question: How does the interviewee define the boundaries of data science? How do they define/what do they consider legitimate data science expertise? Write up 10 open-ended questions in preparation for the interview that aim to unpack this theme. You should submit these 10 interview questions along with your memo in your Google Drive.\n\n\nDuring the interview\nAsk the interviewee if they are comfortable with you recording the conversation. You may record with their express permission. If they do not agree to recording, you should be prepared to take notes during the interview.\n\n\nAnalyzing the interview\nYou may wish to use this worksheet to help you with your analysis. However, you are not required to submit this worksheet with your memo.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your interview, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting what was discussed throughout the conversation. Your write-up should address the prompt: How does the interviewee define the boundaries of data science? How do they define/what do they consider legitimate data science expertise? I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent writes/submits 10 relevant interview questions developed in preparation for the interview.\nStudent writes/submits a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting what was discussed in the interview.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment, you will observe a setting in which data figures centrally. You may choose to observe a class engaging in some form of data collection, a hack-a-thon, or even a friend working on a coding assignment for a data science course. The only data setting that I discourage for this assignment is talks that are being presented on-line. These are better suited for the discourse analysis mini-project. As you observe, you will be aiming to gather data that addresses one of the following two questions: 1) How are data practices embodied in this data environment, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data? OR 2) What rituals are engaged in this data, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data?\n\nBefore the Event\nPrior to your observation, you need to obtain permission to observe. If you are observing a class, you should get permission from the instructor. If you are observing an event, you should get permission from the organizer. …if a lab, get permission from the lab manager or faculty director, etc. Be sure to cc me when you email to obtain permission. You may use this email template when obtaining permission.\n\n\nDuring the Observation\nThroughout the event you should take extensive field notes (at least 6 double-spaced, typed pages) about the physical environment of the event, how people behave and interact, how people talk about and data, the rituals they perform, the infrastructures they engage, and more generally how data figures into the social setting. You may talk to individuals in the environment to ask clarifying question, but if you do, you should disclose that you are an ethnographer studying the space.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Observation\nYou may wish to use this worksheet to help you with your analysis. However, you are not required to submit this worksheet with your memo.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your observation, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo describing the event and offering a qualitative interpretive analysis responding to either 1) How are data practices embodied in this data environment, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data? OR 2) What rituals are engaged in this data, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data?. I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent submits the equivalent of about 6 double-spaced typed pages of field notes taken during the event.\nStudent writes/submits a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting the event.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevision\nAfter receiving feedback from me on both submissions, you will have an opportunity to revise one of your submissions. This assignment has three steps:\n\nRead this document on creating a revision plan.\nComplete the Revision Plan worksheet.\nRevise your submission in the same document you had previously been working in based on what you outlined in your revision plan.\n\n\nRemember that grammar, spelling, and punctuation concerns should not be included in a revision plan. Those concerns are addressed in a proofreading stage, not a revising stage.\n\n\n\nResources\n\nMemo template is here\nExample Mini-Project 1 are here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDue to IRB restrictions, I cannot provide examples of past Mini-Project 2 assignments. If you are struggling to figure out how to compose the write-up, please plan to visit office hours."

    "section": "Final Project",
    "text": "Final Project\nIn May 2009, Data.gov - a web portal for accessing US government datasets - was launched by then federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra. Following this, in December 2009, then US President Barack Obama signed the Open Government Data Directive, requiring that all federal agencies post at least 3 high value datasets on data.gov within 45 day. A few years later in May 2013, Pres. Obama signed an Executive Order to: “Mak[e] Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information.”\nThe Order required that the US Office of Management and Budgeting, in collaboration with the CIO and CTO, put out and oversee an Open Data Policy. This policy required the following:\n\nData needs to be published in machine-readable formats\nData needs to be licensed openly\nData needs to be described with metadata.\n\n\nPrompt\nFor this assignment, I would like you to imagine that the Data.gov Program Management Office in US General Services Administration Technology Transformation Services, the Office of Government and Information Services (OGIS), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are jointly championing a new initiative to improve the accessibility of open government metadata. Administrative metadata describing how datasets are managed or stewarded gets published with most open government datasets. Similarly, descriptive metadata gets published in the form of data dictionaries that provide official definitions of observations and variables present in the dataset. However, user-friendly descriptions of how the dataset was produced, how standard definitions were chosen, how categories were divided, how measurements get taken, what assumptions and judgments are built into the data, why certain information may be missing, and where and how the data gets referenced is often harder to come by and rarely published in a succinct format accessible to diverse users.\nTo help advance this initiative, imagine the offices will be contracting with a number of teams of consultants to develop a series of dataset user guides. Unlike many existing metadata formats, dataset user guides will be narrative documents. In the process of advancing a similar municipal level initiative, the NYC Open Data Team (with Julia Marden, Tiny Panther Consulting, Sharon Lintz and Jo Polanco) defined dataset user guides as describing “the content of a dataset, how it was created, the agency who maintains it, and how users can begin to use the data.”\nThis semester your project group will develop a user guide for a federal dataset. Each week you will work through exercises that help apply course concepts from that week to the study of this dataset. Note that you will study the dataset ethnographically and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.\nYour final user guide may be presented in any format you wish, and I encourage you to be creative. However, the format you choose should be tailored to an audience that you identify in advance.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nApply the course concepts in studying the provenance of a dataset\nDevelop skill in analyzing social forces and systems\nProduce effective and descriptive data documentation that puts data in context\nPlan and execute a substantive writing revision, while evaluating feedback\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nGroup Contract\nSemiotic Analysis\nPeopling the Data\nData Collection Rituals\nInstitutional Incentives\nDiscourse Analysis\n\n\n\nAssignment Expectations\n\nThe exercises I provide are not graded and not reviewed by me; they are meant to frame your research and help you generate material for the project. I will only be formally reviewing your final user guide submission.\nBecause each group is working on a different dataset, there will likely be components of each exercise that are not relevant to your group; I only expect you to complete about 70% of each exercise. Skip the parts that aren’t relevant to you.\nYou should be meeting with your groups at least one hour each week outside of class to coordinate your work and plan to work an additional hour independently to make progress towards your research.\nThe point of this project is not to perform a statistical analysis on this dataset. Instead, you will study the dataset ethnographically and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.\nBy November, at least part of your group work time should transition from researching the dataset to composing a user guide. Your final submission should not be a compilation of text from the exercises you completed. That text was written for you, not for an outside audience. Part of the goal of this project is to be able to translate your research into information that is accessible to an audience.\n\n\n\nProject Resources\n\nExample User Guide\n\n\n\nCriteria for Completion\n\nStudent team submits a completed group contract, first draft, and final project draft on time.\nStudent team generates a user guide that demonstrates having completed substantial research across all five project exercises.\nStudent team generates a user guide with language, visuals, and formats tailored towards a particular audience."

    "section": "Community Labor",
    "text": "Community Labor\nEthnography is at its best when it involves collaborative inquiry and interpretation. Because of this, I want to encourage us to foster a cooperative community in our classroom. Ethnographers know that building and sustaining strong communities are important and often invisible forms of labor. In an effort to foreground and reward that labor, I’ve built opportunities to contribute to the course community into our grading contract. There are four opportunities for earning community labor points in this course. It will be your responsibility to keep track of your community labor via our course labor log.\n\nContributing on Slack\nThe first opportunity for earning community labor points is through posting in the #sds-237-discussions Slack channel. For every conversation that you initiate in this channel, you will earn 1 community labor point. For every conversation that you respond to in this channel with substantive summary, critique, or reflection, you will earn 1 community labor point. Finally, for every question that you ask or answer in the #sds-237-questions channel, you will earn 1 community labor point.\n\n\nCompleting Group Evaluations\nMid-way through the semester you will have an opportunity to evaluate your own contributions to your group work, along with that of your peers. Completing group evaluations will count for 1 community labor point.\n\n\nParticipating in Peer Review Workshops\nThroughout the semester, I will set up workshops where students may submit their written work for peer review in preparation for assignment submissions. Each peer review workshop that you participate in will count for 2 community labor points.\n\n\nContributing Class Notes\nFollowing a class period, up to two students may type up a 1-page outline of what was covered in that class period and post a link to that outline in #sds-237-class-notes. You can sign-up to serve as the notetaker for a certain class here. These notes should be a full, single-space page, and should make sense to someone that was not present in class. Each class note outline that you contribute will count for 2 community labor points.\nNote that throughout the semester, I may offer additional opportunities to earn community labor points as unexpected forms of course labor arise."

Because we have other activities planned, I will need to cut off discussions if they go too long. Students leading a discussion should start by taking 2-3 minutes to summarize the main arguments of the reading, dicussing how the author supports those arguments. After this, it is up to the student(s) presenting how they wish to structure the remaining time. I’ve had students pose discussion questions to the whole class. I’ve also had students pose questions for small groups to discuss first (note that if you take this option, there is really only time to discuss at most 2 questions; trust me, the time goes by fast). I’ve also had students do more experimental things like create Kahoots or present case studies for the class to think through. It’s up to you! Just get us reflecting on the reading! Often students create slides to help structure the discussion, but this is not necessarily a requirement."
