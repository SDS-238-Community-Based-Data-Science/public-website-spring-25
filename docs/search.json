    "section": "",
    "text": "Course logo designed by Zoe Scheffler, Fall ’21\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout rich documentation, quantitative data can strip away critical context needed to interpret values responsibly. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of data ethnography, demonstrating how qualitative data collection and analysis can be brought to bear on the study of data settings and artifacts. Through experiential exercises, students will learn techniques in field-note writing, participant observation, in-depth interviewing, documentary analysis, and archival research and how they may be used to contextualize the cultural underpinnings of datasets. Students will learn how to visualize datasets in ways that foreground their socio-political provenance in R. Students will also learn how ethnographic methods can be leveraged to improve data documentation and communication. The course will introduce debates regarding the politics of techno-scientific fieldwork. Upon completion of this course, you should be able to:\n\nRecognize, interpret, and communicate the cultural underpinnings of data resources, infrastructures, and practices\nDefine and engage principal methods of ethnography and communicate when and how they may be used in the study of data\nStrategically apply relevant ethnographic methods to the study of a data setting or artifact\nProduce data documentation and visualizations that account for the cultural contexts of data production, categorization, measurement, and use\n\nClasses will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9:25 AM to 10:40 AM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Poirier, she/her/hers.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a cultural anthropologist that studies how civic data gets produced, how communities think about and interface with data, and how data infrastructure can be designed more equitably. My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to predominantly involve group activities and live problem-solving exercises.\n\n\n\nSlackMeeting with Me\n\n\nI can best support students in this course when I can readily keep tabs on our course-related communication. Because of this, I ask that you please don’t email me regarding course-related questions or issues. The best way to get in touch with me is via our course Slack. If you have course-related questions, I encourage you to ask them in the #sds-237-questions channel. When discretion is needed, feel free to DM. Please reserve more formal concerns like grades or accommodation requests for an in-person (or in-person virtual) conversation.\nDuring the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within 24 hours of receiving them. Please note that to maintain my own work-life balance, I don’t answer Slack messages late in the evenings or on the weekends. It’s important that you plan when you start your assignments accordingly.\n\n\nMeeting with me outside of class is a great opportunity for us to chat about what you’re learning in the course, clarify expectations on assignments, and review work in progress. I also love when students drop in to office hours to request book recommendations, discuss career or research paths, or just to say hi!\nThere are two ways to meet with me. If you would like to have a one-on-one private conversation, I ask that you schedule an appointment with me via the booking form on Moodle. For support on class topics, you may drop-in during my regularly scheduled office hours.\n\nMonday, 3:00PM-4:00PM, McConnell 214\nWednesday, 2:00PM-3:00PM, McConnell 214\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will make all course readings available on Perusall, which can be accessed through our course Moodle page.\n\n\n\nThis course will be graded via a grading contract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacobson Center\n\n\n\nSmith’s Jacobson Center asserts that all students can improve their communication and learning skills. I encourage all students to take advantage of their writing support services, workshops, and tutors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparationAttendanceExtensionsAcademic HonestyGenerative AI\n\n\nThis is a 4-credit course with 3 hours per week of in-classroom instructions. Smith expects students to devote 9 out-of-class hours per week to 4-credit classes. I have designed the course assignments and selected the course readings with this target in mind.\n\n\nBecause this course aims to hone certain critical thinking skills, much of the learning happens in class, in collaboration with peers. Attendance in class is both important for your own learning, and for your peers’ learning, as we will spend a good chunk of time in class engaging in group activities and discussions.\nAttendance will be taken each class period. That said, we all have reasons we can’t be available from time-to-time. You may miss three classes with no penalty. You do not need to inform me that you will be absent in these cases, but you should let your group members know. After the third unexcused absence, your grade may drop by a modifier for each class missed. I understand that you may need to be absent beyond these three sessions. Additional absences may be excused due to family/personal difficulties, sickness, or school or career-related activities; however, I will require some form of documentation for these absences. Please speak with your class dean or the Accessibility Resource Center so that we can get documentation of your need.\nI also ask that you make every effort to arrive to class on time. This is a large course, and when students arrive late, it can be distracting for me as the instructor, and it can be distracting to other students in the course. It also makes it difficult for me to plan group activities. Students arriving more than 10 minutes late for class without having informed me ahead of time will be marked as absent.\nIf you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed. Please note that the SDS Program has adopted a shared policy regarding in-person attendance:\n\nIn keeping with Smith’s core identity and mission as an in-person, residential college, SDS affirms College policy (as per the Provost and Dean of the College) that students will attend class in person. SDS courses will not provide options for remote attendance. Students who have been determined to require a remote attendance accommodation by the Accessibility Resource Center will be the only exceptions to this policy. As with any other kind of ADA accommodations, please notify your instructor during the first week of classes to discuss how we can meet your accommodations.\n\n\n\nThis course aims to support you in learning to become more perceptive to data environments surrounding you. Because of this I’ve deliberately spread course assignments out over the semester in order to help you gain practice in consistently paying attention to these environments. This critical mode of thinking can’t be cultivated effectively if the work is being crammed into later parts of the semester. Further, because this course emphasizes student growth over achievement, I also want to ensure that I can provide feedback on your writing in time for you to incorporate it into future assignments.\nThere is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\nNote that this policy does not apply to reading assignments/Perusall annotations. Reading assignments/Perusall annotations need to be completed by the due date for credit.\n\n\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as chatGPT\n\n\n\nThe use of generative artificial intelligence tools is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in a number of domains of work. Despite the urge to push forward with this innovative technology, there are both pedagogical and social reasons that I do not allow students to use generative AI in the context of this course.\nThis course aims to facilitate the development of your ability to think critically and express your ideas with care. The depth of your learning in this course cannot be assessed if Generative AI is aiding or doing this work for you. This course also encourages reflexivity - i.e. I will ask you often throughout the semester to reflect on and communicate your personal standpoint and how it impacts the way you write about cultural phenomenon. Since many generative AI algorithms act as “black boxes” (i.e. we don’t fully know what data they were trained on and how they operate internally) it’s not possible to be fully account for the standpoint from which generative AI text was generated.\nFurther, there are countless unresolved social concerns that stem from the use of generative AI - from the loss of cultural heritage, to the limiting of human aspirations and viewpoints, to the lack of formal mechanisms for regulating its potential social harms. Generative AI models often undermine scholarly values of credit by training on data harvested from across the internet that content creators have not provided express permission to use for these purposes. As an example, several academic journal articles that I have written were recently sold to Microsoft AI; I did not have an opportunity to opt out of this, and I will not receive any compensation for my contributions. Copyright laws have not been able to keep pace with the technology. This course will teach you how to interrogate how these kinds of social harms can emerge from data-based systems and imagine opportunities for mitigating them; the course itself suggests taking a precautionary approach in the absence of regulation and other safeguards.\nAccordingly, any use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. I will monitor for use of Generative AI by tracking the version history of your Google Documents. Any cases where a large portion of text is copy and pasted into the Document will be treated as plargiarism, unless you have communicated the rationale for doing so with me ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of ConductPrinciples of CommunityPronouns\n\n\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack.\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nI hope that we can foster a collaborative and caring environment in this classroom: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities. Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. “What three words describe how you’re feeling?” “Name one challenge and one success from this week.” “What are you doing for self-care right now?” Thank each other for sharing where they’re at.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge that there is much we don’t know about how our colleagues experience the world. …but don’t ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of.\nCheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.\nAsk questions often in our #sds-237-questions channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nMistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on.\n\n\n\nUsing the proper pronouns for our students is foundational to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a culture of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodationsStudent Well-beingTrigger Warnings\n\n\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center. I can point you to these resources at any time throughout the semester.\n\n\nA trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I can’t always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I’ve set up an anonymous form, available on Moodle, where you can indicate topics for which you would like me to provide a warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoodlePerusallGoogle DriveSlack\n\n\nGrades, forms, and handouts will be available on the course Moodle.\n\n\nAll course readings and recorded lectures will be available on Perusall. You can access Perusall via our course Moodle page.\n\n\nThis semester, you will submit all of your assignments in a Google Drive folder that you will create on the first day of class. You must write your assignments in Google Docs, as I will sometimes use the commenting features in Google docs when grading your work, and I will monitor the version history for plargiarism.\n\n\nOutside of class almost all of our communication will happen via Slack. You can use the following channels\n\n#general: Course announcements (only I can post)\n#sds-237-discussions: Share news articles and relevant opportunities\n#sds-237-questions: Ask and answer questions about our course\n#sds-237-class-notes: Find notes that a designated student took for our class on a given day\nYou can also create private Slack channels with your project group members."

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nGrading contracts have been theorized and implemented in the research of Dr. Peter Elbow and Dr. Asao Inoue. This grading contract is adapted from their work, along with the contracts of Dr. Kate Navickas and Dr. Kati Ahern.\nThis course will be using a grading contract. This means that the grade you ultimately receive for this course is primarily based on the labor that you perform rather than a subjective evaluation of the quality of your work and writing in relation to your colleagues. Your grade will be determined by the extent of your engagement in class, your timely completion of assignments, and how you support the course community. You will still attend to and work to improve the quality of your writing and thinking in this course. You will receive extensive feedback on all of your submissions (from me and from your colleagues), and you will have opportunities to revise. However, you will not receive points or an A, B, C, D, etc. on assignments.\nI’ve experimented with a few alternative grading systems, and I’m particularly excited to continue engaging this system this semester as I believe it aligns with my overarching goals for the course. In this course I am less concerned with your ability to come to a specific answer, to master certain procedures, or to produce standardized deliverables. I’m more concerned with the extent to which this course enables you become more perceptive to data environments, to deepen your critical thinking about data’s cultural meanings, to experiment with your thinking and writing, and to grapple with ethical dilemmas. There’s always room for strengthening these thinking modes further; in fact, every time I teach this course, I find that my own ability to think critically about data deepens through classroom discussions and my reading of student work.\nThere are many benefits to contract grading. Here are there reasons why I’ve opted for a grading contract in this course:"

If you receive an 80% or better on that quiz, it can replace one of your reading annotation assignments. If you receive a 100% on that quiz, it can replace two of your reading annotation assignments.\n\n\n\nDeadlines\nAssignments are due before class (9:25AM EST) on the designated due date. If you take the 24-hour grace period for written assignments (note that this is not an option for reading assignments), the assignment is due before (9:25AM EST) on the day following the designated due date. Any granted extensions are similarly due before 9:25AM EST on the date the deadline is extended to.\n\n\nEarning an A\nYou’ll notice that, in most categories, there’s no difference in the quantity of labor you need to complete to earn an A vs. a B. Earning a B in this course demonstrates that you have completed enough work to meet the course’s learning goals. An A grade in this course indicates that you have exceeded expectations of the course’s learning goals. Please note that this does not mean that you need to do more labor (i.e. more assignments) to earn A. Instead, you need to consistently demonstrate levels of critical thinking on existing course assignments that surpass the minimum requirements.\nTo earn an A in this course, you will need to complete 3 course assignments at an advanced level. Every assignment that you complete at an advanced level will bump your B score up by one grade modifier. You will select the assignments that you want to complete at this level from the labor log, giving you an opportunity to choose where you want to engage deeper. The following chart helps breakdown some of the differences between meeting expectations and exceeding expectations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting Expectations\nExceeding Expectations\n\n\n\n\nDefining and applying course concepts\nDrawing connections between course concepts, critiquing them, or extending them (i.e. offering new ways to think about them)\n\n\nCiting arguments from a course reading to support interpretation and ethnographic arguments\nEngaging more deeply with a course reading - unpacking how its arguments are supported and evaluating its relevance when applied to other ethnographic data\n\n\nImplementing an ethnographic research method\nDefending the selection of a research method and evaluating its strengths/limitations\n\n\nWriting up research findings to convey an argument\nExperimenting with the prose and form of argumentative writing with a clear analytic purpose\n\n\nReporting ethnographic findings in writing\nCritically situating the standpoints of your research findings throughout the writing\n\n\nAnalyzing how a social force shapes the constitution of data\nAnalyzing how multiple, at times competing, social forces shape the constitution of data\n\n\nClearly communicating the contexts that produced data in a format appropriate for a given audience\nCreatively playing with the style and medium of communication in order to better reach and engage an audience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that you may complete a reading annotation assignment at an advanced level by signing up to lead a 15-minute classroom discussion of that reading. I will remind you of this option throughout the first few weeks of the course. This is the only option for completing reading annotation assignments at an advanced level.\n\n\nThe labor log designates which assignments you may attempt to complete at an advanced level. You will be asked to justify why you consider your work on the assignment as advanced in the labor log. Please note that, when justifying why I should consider the work advanced in the labor log, you should clearly explain how the cognitive effort on the assignment surpasses minimum expectations. While you may end up writing more or spending more time on these assignments, exceeding the minimum word count or spending x hours on the assignment would not be considered adequate justification for advanced level work. Being able to justify why your work is advanced demonstrates to me that you have gained a deep understanding of the course’s learning objectives and that you have the ability to communicate what you’ve learned. While it is ultimately up to you to determine what constitutes advanced level work, I am happy to brainstorm ideas with you in office hours.\nPlease note that I reserve the right to deny advanced level designations after reviewing your work, and I also reserve the right to deem an assignment as having been completed at an advanced level, even when you haven’t designated it as such. If ultimately I deny a designation, you may attempt to earn the advanced level designation again. Note that this is a good reason not to wait until the end of the semester to attempt advanced level work.\nAttendance/late arrivals also separate A grades from B grades. Keep in mind that the final grade will be reduced by one grade modifier for each unexcused absence/late arrival beyond the number allowed for your contracted grade. This means that if you completed the work for an A, and you have 4 absences, the final grade will be an A-, and with 5 absences, it would be a B+. I chose to use grade modifiers here so that if you miss just one class beyond the first 3 allotted (i.e. 4 absences), it doesn’t drop your grade so drastically from an A to a B."

    "title": "Grading Contract",
    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\n\nWhat kind of feedback will I receive regarding my work?\nYou will receive extensive and timely feedback on all of your submissions (from me and from your colleagues), and you will have opportunities to revise. I will also provide rubrics for most assignments to indicate how I will evaluate your work. However, you will not receive points or an A, B, C, D, etc. on individual assignments.\n\n\nThere appear to be a significant number of assignments and deadlines in this course. Why is this the case?\nI’ve been very deliberate in pacing your assignments for this course for a number of reasons. Developing the critical thinking skills required of ethnography demands building and consistently practicing observational habits. I want you to leave this class being more mindful of the cultural forces shaping the numbers you see everyday. You are being asked to complete several short reflective writing assignments for this course so that you can start to build those habits. I am aware that this will mean that, sometimes, the writing you produce for this course will not be the very best quality you can produce. Especially for the field note assignments, I have prioritized consistency over depth of reflection because the primary goal there is to encourage you to become more habitually observant. This is also why you have the opportunity to select assignments you want to invest more time on when aiming for an A. If you are struggling with this course’s workload, I recommend coming to talk with me in office hours.\n\n\nHow can I best keep track of my labor in this course?\nThroughout the semester, you will be asked to keep track of your labor via a log that you will share with me. I will reference this log to calculate certain aspects of your final grade. Instructions for using the labor log will be provided in the second week of the course.\n\n\nCan I earn +/- grades in this course?\nEvery advanced level assignment that you receive will bump your contracted grade up by one modifier. In addition, +/- may be assigned to final grades at my discretion in cases where a student’s work consistently exceeds the expectations (+) of their contracted grade or is in some way insufficient (-). Students can track their progress towards a grade modifier in feedback that I provide throughout the semester. Your grade may also be reduced by a grade modifier for each missed class beyond the number associated with your contracted grade.\n\n\nWhat if I need an extension on an assignment?\nThere is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments, except for reading annotations. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\n\n\nCan I ask for extensions or use the grace period for reading annotations?\nReading assignments/Perusall annotations prepare you to participate in class discussions. For this reason, they need to be completed by the due date for credit. I’ve provided considerable leeway to miss a reading annotation assignment from time-to-time in order to accommodate flexibility in this regard.\n\n\nWhat if I don’t know how to complete an assignment at an advanced level?\nIf you are not sure how to complete assignments at an advanced level, you should plan to come talk with me in office hours. I’m more than happy to help you brainstorm ideas!\n\n\nAn assignment deadline is approaching, and I’m unhappy with the quality of my work. What should I do?\nWhile I always encourage students to strive to submit the best work they can, this course’s grading contract, coupled with the course’s revision assignments, permits you to submit work that you know you want to continue to improve upon without penalty. Not submitting assignments at all has the potentially to significantly lower your grade in this course, whereas submitting an assignment that could benefit from more revision will not be detrimental to your grade as long as the minimum submission requirements are met."

David Floyd and David Ourlicht argued that the NYPD had stopped them without reasonable suspicion, and the resulting high-profile case centered around issues of racial profiling in NYC policing. Much of the case against stop and frisk was built from data documenting racial breakdowns of the individuals stopped each year, along with the reason for the stop and the results of the stop. This data was aggregated from a series of forms (known as UF-250s) that officers are required to fill out and report following a stop. These forms collectively showed that 85% of those stopped were Black and Latino despite these sub-groups comprising just over half of the city’s population."

The central flaws in this database all skew toward underestimating the number of unconstitutional stops that occur: the database is incomplete, in that officers do not prepare a UF-250 for every stop they make; it is one-sided, in that the UF250 only records the officer’s version of the story; the UF-250 permits the officer to merely check a series of boxes, rather than requiring the officer to explain the basis for her suspicion; and many of the boxes on the form are inherently subjective and vague (such as ‘furtive movements’). Nonetheless, the analysis of the UF-250 database reveals that at least 200,000 stops were made without reasonable suspicion."

This database came into existence alongside CompStat- a crime reduction strategy implemented in NYC in the 1990s. CompStat required precincts to produce weekly statistics regarding crime rates, officer deployments, stops, and arrests in their communities in order to generate evidence of policing effectiveness. The idea was to hold officers accountable through “timely and accurate intelligence” and “relentless follow-up and assessment.” However, with certain consequences tied to failures to demonstrate reductions in crime, the policies institutionally incentivized data manipulation - an issue colloquially referred to as “juking the stats.” Whistleblowing officers have presented audio recordings of their commanders demanding that they conduct more stops to meet quotas, and deceptively classifying crimes."

These are all examples of data quality issues regarding “disclosure datasets” - tabular datasets produced in accordance with laws requiring various kinds of disclosure. The most significant defining feature of disclosure datasets is that they aggregate information produced and reported by the same institutions they are meant to hold accountable. Further, the values reported in disclosure datasets can lead to adverse actions - either formal or informal – taken against the reporting institutions. Combined, these issues institutionally incentivize misreporting and deceptive accounting practices."

We might, for instance, contrast disclosure data with evaluative data – where people and institutions are not self-assessed, but instead assessed by an external evaluator. Examples include Yelp reviews of businesses and student evaluations of teaching effectiveness. We might also contrast disclosure data with surveillance data – where real-time technological systems track activities to hold folks accountable. Examples of such data include police body cameras and consumer credit tracking. Karen Levy’s work on electronic monitoring systems in the US trucking industry provides a compelling narrative on the social impact of surveillance data. In recognition that each of these datasets emerge from situated and delimited perspectives, we can point to concerns regarding data quality and bias in all of these classes of accountability data.\nIn what follows, I will focus on three kinds of data quality concerns that arise based on the institutional configurations that underpin the production of records for disclosure datasets:"

    "text": "False Reporting\n\n\n\nLying or misreporting data\nAuditing can be challenging\n\n\n ^Sample HMDA Data Collection Form^\n\n\n\nFalse reporting involves deliberate efforts to falsify records; it’s flat out lying. While institutions that aggregate disclosure reports into a dataset often attempt to curb false reporting through auditing efforts, small scale instances of false reporting can be inordinately difficult to detect given that the data systems are designed to tell the story from the perspective of the reporters.\nFor example, in order to ensure that financial institutions are in compliance with fair lending laws in the U.S. (such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act), lenders are required to collect and report data on an applicant’s ethnicity, race, gender, and income when they apply for a mortgage. When reporting data relating to race, ethnicity, and gender, lenders are legally required to submit the information that applicants self-report when filling out a loan application to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). However, in cases where an applicant elects not to provide their demographic data, lenders are required to record race, ethnicity, and gender based on visual observation of the applicant or the applicant’s surname. In one of the most notable cases of intentional HMDA misreporting, a CFPB investigation found that, for over three years, loan officers at Freedom Mortgage (one of the top ten lending institutions in the U.S.) were instructed to list “non-Hispanic White” as the race and ethnicity for every applicant that elected not to provide demographic data.\nSimilarly one of the most novel disclosure datasets my lab has been looking at is called Open Payments. To monitor for potential medical conflicts of interest, medical drug and device companies are required to disclose payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. This is mandated by the passing of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (2010). Until recently, there has been little enforcement of the Sunshine Act, so cases of misreporting or failures to report have gone largely unrecognized. …but in 2020, the first settlement for violations to the Sunshine Act was announced. In efforts to get a South Dakota neurosurgeon to adopt their infusion pumps, Medtronic agreed to sponsor more than 100 events at a restaurant the neurosurgeon owned. Medtronic agreed to pay $9.2 million to resolve allegations for failure to report.\nIn terms of data quality, false reporting calls into question the accuracy and validity of the data."

    "text": "Deceptive Accounting\n\n\n\nNot technically false but deliberately misleading\nTakes advantage of ambiguities in standards or laws\nOften involves “creative” approaches to measurement or classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can trace other cases of reporting that result in information that is not technically false, but deliberately misleading. For instance, institutions might take advantage of loopholes in reporting standards or leverage vagueness in the reporting requirements to cast their activities in a more positive light.\nAn example of this comes from the environmental health domain. The EPA’s Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986 established the Toxic Release Inventory as a mechanism to monitor and inform the public of toxic emissions released in their communities. Every year, certain U.S. industrial facilities are required to report to the EPA the amounts of certain chemical on-site and off-site releases.\nNotably, while this Act mandates reporting of emissions, it does not mandate monitoring of emissions. While other environmental regulations do set certain monitoring standards for specific TRI chemicals and pollution activities, for all other chemicals and activities, facilities are required to report based on a “reasonable estimate” of releases and other waste management quantities. Because the data is self-reported, this provides a lot of flexibility to facilities to determine how they go about measuring emissions. Studies have shown that year-to-year changes in emissions at large facilities often have more to do with changes in estimation methods and interpretations of the law, rather than actual reductions in emissions. These are often called “phantom reductions” - where emissions just disappear from the books without indication of how the facility actually cleaned up their act.\nIn our research into disclosure datasets, my lab has identified a number of other examples of deceptive accounting. For instance, when reporting campaign spending, candidates will sometimes hide large payments by submitting them to consulting firms that then disburse the payments to other organizations. Historically, candidates did not have to disclose the payments’ ultimate recipients. …and the concept of “juking the stats” in policing is a direct example of this deceptive accounting practice, with officers learning to play the CompStat numbers game.\nIn terms of data quality, deceptive accounting calls into question the representativeness of the data - or in other words, the degree to which it represents what we think it represents."

    "text": "Discursive Risk of Regulatory Burden\n\nScope of dataset determined by reporting thresholds\nStakeholders have advocated for strengthening or loosening thresholds in line with certain political commitments\n“Regulatory burden” discourse has been powerful tool for loosening reporting requirements\n\n\nFinally, the information that ultimately appears in a disclosure dataset is often shaped by a series of legal standards regarding who has to report and when they have to report. These standards are not neutral, and tend to evolve as stakeholders with certain political commitments towards transparency and institutional accountability call for amendments. Certain stakeholders advocate on behalf of stricter requirements and more data reporting in efforts to secure transparency and accountability, whereas other stakeholders advocate on behalf of loosening the requirements. Notably, one of the most powerful weapons against strengthening disclosure dataset programs has been discourse around “regulatory burden”. Businesses cite the cost and lack of feasibility of filling out paperwork when advocating against data collection. For instance, under the George W. Bush Administration, the TRI “Burden Reduction Rule” significantly raised the threshold regarding how much pollution a facility needed to emit before reporting requirements kicked in. Just recently, amendments to HMDA raised the threshold regarding the volume of loans a bank needs a originate for reporting requirements to kick in. The pressures Covid-19 had placed on banks was cited as a reason for this change. … and regulatory burden discourse has been effectively leveraged to keep the US’s National Use of Force database – where police officers disclose when they use force against citizens – a voluntary data program.\nWhen regulatory burden discourse is successful, fewer institutions are required to report on fewer activities, diminishing what is tracked in the data. Thresholds tend to fluctuate in line with political changeover. For instance, the stringency of TRI reporting often correlates with the political leanings of presidential administrations. This has meant that the definitions underpinning disclosure datasets are quite malleable - subject to change in conjunction with different modes of social advocacy. This malleability is a double-edged sword for many community groups calling for increased accountability. In one sense, it ensures that disclosure programs can continuously be strengthened. However, changing reporting standards makes it difficult to perform year-to-year comparisons of the data. …which is often needed to measure whether institutions are “cleaning up” their acts.\nIn terms of data quality, this discursive risk calls into question the scope and comprehensiveness of the data."

    "text": "Final Project Resources\nThis semester your project group will develop a user guide for a federal dataset. You will complete a series of exercises in class to support you in writing the guide. These exercises are not graded; they are meant to frame your research and help you generate material for the project. You should work on relevant aspects of them weekly with your group in order to make progress towards the final product. While these exercises will include both qualitative and computational exercises, the point of this project is not to perform a statistical analysis on this dataset. Instead, you will study the dataset ethnographically and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.\n\nProject Description\nRose’s Project Guide Sheet\nDataset Loading Instructions\nExample User Guide\n\nBelow I’ve outlined completion criteria for the two non-written assignments for this course.\n\nReading Annotations\nEach week a selection of course readings will be posted as a single assignment on Perusall - a system for students to collaboratively annotate course readings. To earn this credit, you will be expected to post 3 quality annotations per assignment to Perusall. (Note that a single assignment can have multiple readings, but you need only submit 3 annotations total. You do not need to annotate every reading in the assignment.) A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each other’s annotations. Annotations must be completed before class to receive credit.\n\n\nCommunity Labor\nEthnography is at its best when it involves collaborative inquiry and interpretation. Because of this, I want to encourage us to foster a cooperative community in our classroom. Ethnographers know that building and sustaining strong communities are important and often invisible forms of labor. In an effort to foreground and reward that labor, I’ve built opportunities to contribute to the course community into our grading contract. There are four opportunities for earning community labor points in this course. It will be your responsibility to keep track of your community labor via our course labor log (see FAQ).\n\nContributing on Slack\nThe first opportunity for earning community labor points is through posting in the #sds-237-discussions Slack channel. For every conversation that you initiate in this channel, you will earn 1 community labor point. For every conversation that you respond to in this channel with substantive summary, critique, or reflection, you will earn 1 community labor point. Finally, for every question that you answer in the #sds-237-questions channel, you will earn 1 community labor point.\n\n\nCompleting Group Evaluations\nMid-way through the semester you will have an opportunity to evaluate your own contributions to your group work, along with that of your peers. Your feedback will be shared with members of your group. Completing group evaluations will count for 1 community labor point.\n\n\nParticipating in Peer Review Workshops\nThroughout the semester, I will set up workshops where students may submit their written work for peer review in preparation for assignment submissions. Each peer review workshop that you participate in will count for 2 community labor points.\n\n\nContributing Class Notes\nFollowing a class period, up to two students may type up a 1-page outline of what was covered in that class period and post a link to that outline in #sds-237-class-notes. You can sign-up to serve as the notetaker for a certain class here. These notes should be a full, single-space page, and should make sense to someone that was not present in class. Each class note outline that you contribute will count for 2 community labor points.\nNote that throughout the semester, I may offer additional opportunities to earn community labor points as unexpected forms of course labor arise.\n\nThe final project will be completed in groups, and considerable chunks of the group project will be completed in class on Thursdays. While I will not formally be taking attendance for this course, I reserve the right to adjust your final grade by a letter grade if you’ve missed more than three classes involving final project group work. Be sure to reach out to me early on if there are extenuating circumstances that will consistently impact your attendance."

    "text": "Mini-Projects + Substantive Revision\nThe course mini-projects will provide you with opportunities to practice ethnographic research and cultural analysis. Mini-projects are the predominant way that you will practice the Data Ethnography Methods learning dimension in this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease note that you may complete the mini-projects independently or in a pair. If you choose to complete the project as a pair, both students must participate in data collection, analysis, and writing. Be prepared to submit a short paragraph describing the breakdown of labor, along with your write-up.\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nIdentify, implement, and critique data ethnography research methods\nDevelop observational habits in data-saturated environments\nDevelop skill in analyzing social forces and systems\nPlan and execute a substantive writing revision, while evaluating feedback\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\nInfrastructural Analysis (MP 1)Discourse Analysis (MP 1)Interview (MP 2)Participant Observation (MP 2)\n\n\nFor this assignment, you will select a standard classification system that supports a dataset or system. You will then investigate that information infrastructure through a socio-cultural lens, aiming to respond to the question: What is a cultural assumption embedded in this classification system that goes on to shape the social outcomes of the data it supports? You may briefly research the history of changes to the infrastructure; however, this assignment is not a literature review, and you should limit your use of secondary sources to support your arguments. This paper should represent your cultural analysis of this dataset, not that of others. To do so, you should closely examine the structure of the classification system, using the Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet.\n\nSelecting a data infrastructure\nBefore you select an infrastructure, you should identify a public dataset that organizes information into a series categories\nExamples of classification systems that I’ve seen referenced in public datasets include:\n\nStandard Industrial Classification System (SIC) or the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)\nCarnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education\nBISAC Subject Headings List\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)\nUniform Crime Reporting crime classifications\nAssociation of Computing Machinery (ACM) Computing Classification System\nCandid’s Philanthropy Classification System (PCS)\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the data infrastructure\nTo analyze this infrastructure, you should complete the Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet, which you will submit along with the final write-up. You should aim to answer most of the questions in this worksheet, but you do not need to answer all of them. To answer these questions, you can rely on a diverse range of resources. First and foremost, you should browse the classification system itself, noting how concepts are organized. However, to answer the questions in the worksheet, you may also need to review the websites of the organizations that created/steward the classification, review changelogs that identify changes to the classification, and conduct research to find journal articles, news articles, blog posts, or other grey literature, discussing the classification.Finally, you should consider how everything you learned shaped the way values are presented in the dataset where you originally identified this infrastructure.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo presenting an an answer to the question: What is a cultural assumption embedded in this classification system that goes on to shape the social outcomes of the data it supports? I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. You should engage thick description as you detail the structure and organization of the infrastructure and interpret its symbolic meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nI want to emphasize that this is not a literature review, and you should not approach this assignment simply by regurgitating what you learn in sources you find. Instead, you should focus on analyzing the ways in which the infrastructure both enables and delimits knowledge production by closely studying how its component parts are organized and how they impact your dataset, along with which stakeholder groups advocated for certain changes. The sources you find should serve to provide context for the points that you make. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent submits a mostly complete Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet.\nStudent writes a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting the data infrastructure. All sources are properly cited in the write-up.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment, you have two options: you can 1) watch 1 video (at least 45 minutes long) of a talk about data delivered by a data scientist, or 2) three TED talks (at least 15 minutes each) about data. Please confirm your selection with me ahead of time by DM’ing me on Slack.\n\nAnalyzing the talks\nFollowing the framework in the Discourse Analysis Worksheet, you should examine how data is talked about in the video(s). Consider the epistemologies vocalized, the binary oppositions that structure the language, the rhetorical strategies used, and what this tells us about data culture. You should take detailed notes by responding to several sections within the worksheet. As “data” to back up claims regarding what you notice about the discourse, you should transcribe a series of quotes from the talks. You can add these quotes directly to the worksheet. You will submit the worksheet with your final write-up.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo detailing an argument about the data discourse conveyed in the talk(s). What cultural assumptions about (choose one): 1) what data is, 2) data’s relationship with truth, or 3) what makes data good vs. bad … are reflected in discourse about data? I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. Direct quotations should be referenced throughout (and cited) to back up your claims, but do not count towards the overall word count. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you choose to watch three TED Talks, please note that you should still only present one argument, synthesizing what you learn across all three videos. This means that you should compare discourse across multiple talks in each paragraph. Assignments that present three distinct discourse analyses/do not offer in-paragraph synthesis and comparison will not receive full credit.\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent submits the Discourse Analysis Worksheet with several sections completed.\nStudent writes a 750-1000 word memo detailing the discourse of the talk(s). Direct quotations are included as evidence, and not included in the overall word count.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph. If analyzing multiple talks, student offers comparison and synthesis in each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment you will conduct a 30-minute Zoom interview with an individual for whom data figures centrally in their work. The goal of your interview will be to deepen understanding of the cultures of data work.\n\nIdentifying a data professional, scheduling an interview, and obtaining consent\nIf you choose this assignment, it will be your responsibility to identify a data professional, reach out to them (cc’ing me), and coordinate an interview time well in advance of the project due date. There is a template for emailing an individual provided here, along with a consent form the person you interview should sign. Keep in mind that, while your SDS professors may be an obvious first choice, they cannot support interviews with all of the students in our course. I encourage you to think expansively about who you might interview. I’m happy to offer suggestions on identifying an appropriate person in office hours.\n\n\nPreparing for the interview\nYour interview should address the question: How does the interviewee define the boundaries of data science? How do they define/what do they consider legitimate data science expertise? Write up 10 open-ended questions in preparation for the interview that aim to unpack this theme. You should submit these 10 interview questions along with your memo in your Google Drive.\n\n\nDuring the interview\nAsk the interviewee if they are comfortable with you recording the conversation. You may record with their express permission. If they do not agree to recording, you should be prepared to take notes during the interview.\n\n\nAnalyzing the interview\nYou may wish to use this worksheet to help you with your analysis. However, you are not required to submit this worksheet with your memo.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your interview, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting what was discussed throughout the conversation. Your write-up should address the prompt: How does the interviewee define the boundaries of data science? How do they define/what do they consider legitimate data science expertise? I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent writes/submits 10 relevant interview questions developed in preparation for the interview.\nStudent writes/submits a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting what was discussed in the interview.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment, you will observe a setting in which data figures centrally. You may choose to observe a class engaging in some form of data collection, a hack-a-thon, or even a friend working on a coding assignment for a data science course. The only data setting that I discourage for this assignment is talks that are being presented on-line. These are better suited for the discourse analysis mini-project. As you observe, you will be aiming to gather data that addresses one of the following two questions: 1) How are data practices embodied in this data environment, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data? OR 2) What rituals are engaged in this data, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data?\n\nBefore the Event\nPrior to your observation, you need to obtain permission to observe. If you are observing a class, you should get permission from the instructor. If you are observing an event, you should get permission from the organizer. …if a lab, get permission from the lab manager or faculty director, etc. Be sure to cc me when you email to obtain permission. You may use this email template when obtaining permission.\n\n\nDuring the Observation\nThroughout the event you should take extensive field notes (at least 6 double-spaced, typed pages) about the physical environment of the event, how people behave and interact, how people talk about and data, the rituals they perform, the infrastructures they engage, and more generally how data figures into the social setting. You may talk to individuals in the environment to ask clarifying question, but if you do, you should disclose that you are an ethnographer studying the space.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Observation\nYou may wish to use this worksheet to help you with your analysis. However, you are not required to submit this worksheet with your memo.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your observation, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo describing the event and offering a qualitative interpretive analysis responding to either 1) How are data practices embodied in this data environment, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data? OR 2) What rituals are engaged in this data, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data?. I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent submits the equivalent of about 6 double-spaced typed pages of field notes taken during the event.\nStudent writes/submits a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting the event.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevision\nAfter receiving feedback from me on both submissions, you will have an opportunity to revise one of your submissions. This assignment has three steps:\n\nRead this document on creating a revision plan.\nComplete the Revision Plan worksheet.\nRevise your submission in the same document you had previously been working in based on what you outlined in your revision plan.\n\n\nRemember that grammar, spelling, and punctuation concerns should not be included in a revision plan. Those concerns are addressed in a proofreading stage, not a revising stage.\n\n\n\nResources\n\nMemo template is here\nExample Mini-Project 1 are here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDue to IRB restrictions, I cannot provide examples of past Mini-Project 2 assignments. If you are struggling to figure out how to compose the write-up, please plan to visit office hours."

    "section": "Final Project",
    "text": "Final Project\nIn May 2009, Data.gov - a web portal for accessing US government datasets - was launched by then federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra. Following this, in December 2009, then US President Barack Obama signed the Open Government Data Directive, requiring that all federal agencies post at least 3 high value datasets on data.gov within 45 day. A few years later in May 2013, Pres. Obama signed an Executive Order to: “Mak[e] Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information.”\nThe Order required that the US Office of Management and Budgeting, in collaboration with the CIO and CTO, put out and oversee an Open Data Policy. This policy required the following:\n\nData needs to be published in machine-readable formats\nData needs to be licensed openly\nData needs to be described with metadata.\n\n\nPrompt\nFor this assignment, I would like you to imagine that the Data.gov Program Management Office in US General Services Administration Technology Transformation Services, the Office of Government and Information Services (OGIS), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are jointly championing a new initiative to improve the accessibility of open government metadata. Administrative metadata describing how datasets are managed or stewarded gets published with most open government datasets. Similarly, descriptive metadata gets published in the form of data dictionaries that provide official definitions of observations and variables present in the dataset. However, user-friendly descriptions of how the dataset was produced, how standard definitions were chosen, how categories were divided, how measurements get taken, what assumptions and judgments are built into the data, why certain information may be missing, and where and how the data gets referenced is often harder to come by and rarely published in a succinct format accessible to diverse users.\nTo help advance this initiative, imagine the offices will be contracting with a number of teams of consultants to develop a series of dataset user guides. Unlike many existing metadata formats, dataset user guides will be narrative documents. In the process of advancing a similar municipal level initiative, the NYC Open Data Team (with Julia Marden, Tiny Panther Consulting, Sharon Lintz and Jo Polanco) defined dataset user guides as describing “the content of a dataset, how it was created, the agency who maintains it, and how users can begin to use the data.”\nThis semester your project group will develop a user guide for a federal dataset. Each week you will work through exercises that help apply course concepts from that week to the study of this dataset. Note that you will study the dataset ethnographically and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.\nYour final user guide may be presented in any format you wish, and I encourage you to be creative. However, the format you choose should be tailored to an audience that you identify in advance.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nApply the course concepts in studying the provenance of a dataset\nDevelop skill in analyzing social forces and systems\nProduce effective and descriptive data documentation that puts data in context\nPlan and execute a substantive writing revision, while evaluating feedback\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nGroup Contract\nSemiotic Analysis\nPeopling the Data\nData Collection Rituals\nInstitutional Incentives\nDiscourse Analysis\n\n\n\nAssignment Expectations\n\nThe exercises I provide are not graded and not reviewed by me; they are meant to frame your research and help you generate material for the project. I will only be formally reviewing your final user guide submission.\nBecause each group is working on a different dataset, there will likely be components of each exercise that are not relevant to your group; I only expect you to complete about 70% of each exercise. Skip the parts that aren’t relevant to you.\nYou should be meeting with your groups at least one hour each week outside of class to coordinate your work and plan to work an additional hour independently to make progress towards your research.\nThe point of this project is not to perform a statistical analysis on this dataset. Instead, you will study the dataset ethnographically and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.\nBy November, at least part of your group work time should transition from researching the dataset to composing a user guide. Your final submission should not be a compilation of text from the exercises you completed. That text was written for you, not for an outside audience. Part of the goal of this project is to be able to translate your research into information that is accessible to an audience.\n\n\n\nProject Resources\n\nExample User Guide\n\n\n\nCriteria for Completion\n\nStudent team submits a completed group contract, first draft, and final project draft on time.\nStudent team generates a user guide that demonstrates having completed substantial research across all five project exercises.\nStudent team generates a user guide with language, visuals, and formats tailored towards a particular audience."

Because of this, I want to encourage us to foster a cooperative community in our classroom. Ethnographers know that building and sustaining strong communities are important and often invisible forms of labor. In an effort to foreground and reward that labor, I’ve built opportunities to contribute to the course community into our grading contract. There are four opportunities for earning community labor points in this course. It will be your responsibility to keep track of your community labor via our course labor log.\n\nContributing on Slack\nThe first opportunity for earning community labor points is through posting in the #sds-237-discussions Slack channel. For every conversation that you initiate in this channel, you will earn 1 community labor point. For every conversation that you respond to in this channel with substantive summary, critique, or reflection, you will earn 1 community labor point. Finally, for every question that you ask or answer in the #sds-237-questions channel, you will earn 1 community labor point.\n\n\nCompleting Group Evaluations\nMid-way through the semester you will have an opportunity to evaluate your own contributions to your group work, along with that of your peers. Completing group evaluations will count for 1 community labor point.\n\n\nParticipating in Peer Review Workshops\nThroughout the semester, I will set up workshops where students may submit their written work for peer review in preparation for assignment submissions. Each peer review workshop that you participate in will count for 2 community labor points.\n\n\nContributing Class Notes\nFollowing a class period, up to two students may type up a 1-page outline of what was covered in that class period and post a link to that outline in #sds-237-class-notes. You can sign-up to serve as the notetaker for a certain class here. These notes should be a full, single-space page, and should make sense to someone that was not present in class. Each class note outline that you contribute will count for 2 community labor points.\nNote that throughout the semester, I may offer additional opportunities to earn community labor points as unexpected forms of course labor arise."

To earn this credit, you will be expected to post 3 quality annotations per assignment to Perusall. A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each other’s annotations. Annotations must be completed before class to receive credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA single assignment can have multiple readings, but you need only submit 3 annotations total.

    "text": "This entry documents a data environment Casey MacGibbon observed on 2023-02-10 in The Human Performance Labratory, Scott Gym, Smith College. The observations were written up on 2023-02-19.\nMy stopwatch hits 20:00:00.\n“Alright, it’s been five minutes since I last asked, how rigorous do you feel your exercise is on a scale of 6-20?” I say, holding up a reference board for the participant. She points to a 12, which is labeled as “Somewhat hard.” She is on minute twenty of her acute bout of exercise, where she is walking at a moderate pace on the treadmill, and we are monitoring her heart rate from an electronic wristband.\nRecently, I have begun research work and analysis for the Witkowski Vascular Function Lab, and this was the first time I went in to observe a visit with a participant. I am new to the lab, and my perspective still feels a bit like an outsiders’. After the visit, I asked Dr. Witkowski explained that each number on the reference board corresponded to a heart rate by multiplying the number by 10, essentially acting as a participant’s heart rate experience. She explained to me how there are two different “data streams” throughout the lab, one being objective and the other subjective.\nThe idea of objective/subjective data is an example of a binary opposition: a pair of terms with opposite meanings. I noticed how much more “objective” data collection was valued, while a lot of the data collected from the participant was thought of as “subjective,” and thought of to be more subject to inaccuracy. Data is categorized as one or the other.\nNo data can be subjective, because the mere decision to begin collecting data means that there are expectations and biases put into the collection of data. Though the target heart rate is an “objective” part of the study because it is numerical, does not mean it is without bias. Heart rate calculations have historically ignored weight, height, average physical activity, and many other factors. This is just one example of how all of the data is biased, and cannot be placed into these categorizations. Additionally, the “data streams” figure of speech is a part of popular data discourse, contributing to the idea that data is a natural resource waiting to be found, untainted and untouched by human interference.\nDiscourse is the way that people talk about and engage with a certain thing/person, and dominant discourse can often characterize how we think about this topic as a society. The imagery of a data stream indicates that data is natural and is something we can “drink” from at any time. In reality, all data is collected from humans, who are limited in their standpoints and views."

The observations were written up on 2023-03-29.\n\nPlease note that certain details in this entry were anonymized for the purposes of sharing. Names and titles have been changed.\n\nThe Center [redacted] is on the first floor of [redacted] down a long hall of labs. I go there regularly for my research project and am always greeted with a friendly face – Morgan. They’re the technical director of the Center and help students with research. This includes teaching students to use instruments that some senior researchers don’t even get their hands on. They’re a patient teacher and helpful during experiments. They’re also a core part of a lot of the data labor (work that goes into creating, supporting, processing, and analyzing information) that happens in my research field.\nWhile Morgan is highly valued on a personal amongst colleagues, on an institutional level, they disappear a little bit. While most people outside the department recognize the research professors do, Morgan fades into the background a little more. They also don’t get to do their own research, and the Center’s budget is generally devoted to making sure professors get what they need for their research. As a result, despite the amount that they help with student research, Morgan rarely gets put on papers as an author.\nHowever, Morgan does love their job. They’re excellent at training people on equipment and prefer being technical support to lecturing. They know the ins and outs of the instruments and do more hands-on work than most professors. Data produced in the Center is as accurate and uncontaminated as possible because of the care that they take when working. The data provides an excellent basis for publications. However, the labor that went into creating that data is hidden in the final publication.\nThis obscuration of labor says a lot about what kind of labor academia values. Spoiler alert: it’s not “grunt” work. Instead, it values high level thinking. This ignores that the “grunt” work also requires expertise and is vital to the research that professors do. As an undergraduate researcher who gets to be first author but also is doing the “grunt” work, it is easy to see this discrepancy. I do actively benefit from this hierarchy in many ways because of my educational and career trajectory, but it appears that the more one benefits, the harder it is to notice. This is partially because the people who benefit most often don’t do much lab work.\n…I will add more as I get permission from former students."

Typically field notes will describe a physical environment and the participants in that environment (including appearances, roles, behaviors, moods, interactions, conversations, etc.). Field notes will also interpret what was observed, considering how the empirical material affirms, contests, or transforms how we understand cultural phenomena. In data ethnography, the social environment under consideration can be anywhere data is produced, applied, presented, or talked about. This assignment is about paying attention to the numbers (and other forms of data) that inhabit daily life and practicing cultural interpretation.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nRecall, define, explain, apply, and synthesize course concepts and ideas\nEngage the genre and practice of thick description\nDevelop observational habits in data-saturated environments\nDevelop skill in interpreting cultural meaning\n\n\n\nInstructions\nConsider a statistic, dataset, data standard, data infrastructure, or data collection environment that you encountered in the past two weeks. Write 300-400 words, first, detailing the environment and, second, responding to one of the following prompts.\n\nWhat cultural assumptions about what knowledge is and how knowledge is produced can you glean from this data environment?\nHow do binary oppositions structure discourse about data in this environment? With what consequences?\nWhat metaphors are used to characterize data in this environment, and what assumptions about data are conveyed through these metaphors?\nWhat is one master narrative architecturally designed into this data infrastructure? How does that narrative manifest both semiotically and materially through the data infrastructure?\nWhat invisible forms of labor sustain this data infrastructure or data environment? How do the individuals that engage in that labor approach and care for their work? What social forces render that work invisible?\nHow is data science defined in this space? Through what kinds of boundary work do social groups advocate for what should count as legitimate data science? What are the social consequences of this definitional work?\nWhat counts as credible data expertise in this data environment? How do these ideas mediate who gets a voice in the data environment?\nIn what ways are data practices embodied in this environment? How does attention to embodied practice change the ways we understand the data?\nWhat rituals do data collectors engage in this data environment? What shared beliefs motivate these rituals, and how do the rituals manifest in the “raw” data that gets produced?\nWhat stakes do individuals have in how numbers in this data environment get reported? How do social or financial incentives to have the numbers meet or beat certain thresholds animate how individuals behave and the choices they make in relation to this data collection practice, data analysis, or data reporting? Why do those incentives exist?\nHow is the meaning of this statistic or data value socially debated, negotiated, or settled upon? At what thresholds do the data values become actionable, and how do social groups determine levels of actionability? How and under what conditions do these decisions get made?\nHow are data socially mobilized in this space? What strategies do individuals, institutions, or social groups engage to render the data persuasive?\n\n\n\nSample Work\n\nPrevious Student Field Notes here\nHere’s an example of some very short ““thick description”” write-ups of two data environments from my own research.\n\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent writes 300-400 words about a statistic, dataset, data standard, or data collection environment.\nStudent writes about a data situation encountered in the past two weeks.\nStudent responds to a prompt, engaging course concepts to interpret the cultural meaning of the data situation analyzed."

My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to predominantly involve group activities and live problem-solving exercises.\n\n\n\nSlackMeeting with Me\n\n\nI can best support students in this course when I can readily keep tabs on our course-related communication. Because of this, I ask that you please don’t email me regarding course-related questions or issues. The best way to get in touch with me is via our course Slack. If you have course-related questions, I encourage you to ask them in the #sds-237-questions channel. When discretion is needed, feel free to DM. Please reserve more formal concerns like grades or accommodation requests for an in-person (or in-person virtual) conversation.\nDuring the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within 24 hours of receiving them. Please note that to maintain my own work-life balance, I don’t answer Slack messages late in the evenings or on the weekends. It’s important that you plan when you start your assignments accordingly.\n\n\nMeeting with me outside of class is a great opportunity for us to chat about what you’re learning in the course, clarify expectations on assignments, and review work in progress. I also love when students drop in to office hours to request book recommendations, discuss career or research paths, or just to say hi!\nThere are two ways to meet with me. If you would like to have a one-on-one private conversation, I ask that you schedule an appointment with me via the booking form on Moodle.

    "text": "PreparationAttendanceExtensionsAcademic HonestyGenerative AI\n\n\nThis is a 4-credit course with 3 hours per week of in-classroom instructions. Smith expects students to devote 9 out-of-class hours per week to 4-credit classes. I have designed the course assignments and selected the course readings with this target in mind.\n\n\nBecause this course aims to hone certain critical thinking skills, much of the learning happens in class, in collaboration with peers. Attendance in class is both important for your own learning, and for your peers’ learning, as we will spend a good chunk of time in class engaging in group activities and discussions.\nAttendance will be taken each class period. That said, we all have reasons we can’t be available from time-to-time. You may miss three classes with no penalty. You do not need to inform me that you will be absent in these cases, but you should let your group members know. After the third unexcused absence, your grade may drop by a modifier for each class missed. I understand that you may need to be absent beyond these three sessions. Additional absences may be excused due to family/personal difficulties, sickness, or school or career-related activities; however, I will require some form of documentation for these absences. Please speak with your class dean or the Accessibility Resource Center so that we can get documentation of your need.\nI also ask that you make every effort to arrive to class on time. This is a large course, and when students arrive late, it can be distracting for me as the instructor, and it can be distracting to other students in the course. It also makes it difficult for me to plan group activities. Students arriving more than 10 minutes late for class without having informed me ahead of time will be marked as absent.\nIf you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed. Please note that the SDS Program has adopted a shared policy regarding in-person attendance:\n\nIn keeping with Smith’s core identity and mission as an in-person, residential college, SDS affirms College policy (as per the Provost and Dean of the College) that students will attend class in person. SDS courses will not provide options for remote attendance. Students who have been determined to require a remote attendance accommodation by the Accessibility Resource Center will be the only exceptions to this policy. As with any other kind of ADA accommodations, please notify your instructor during the first week of classes to discuss how we can meet your accommodations.\n\n\n\nThis course aims to support you in learning to become more perceptive to data environments surrounding you. Because of this I’ve deliberately spread course assignments out over the semester in order to help you gain practice in consistently paying attention to these environments. This critical mode of thinking can’t be cultivated effectively if the work is being crammed into later parts of the semester. Further, because this course emphasizes student growth over achievement, I also want to ensure that I can provide feedback on your writing in time for you to incorporate it into future assignments.\nThere is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\nNote that this policy does not apply to reading assignments/Perusall annotations. Reading assignments/Perusall annotations need to be completed by the due date for credit.\n\n\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as chatGPT\n\n\n\nThe use of generative artificial intelligence tools is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in a number of domains of work. Despite the urge to push forward with this innovative technology, there are both pedagogical and social reasons that I do not allow students to use generative AI in the context of this course.\nThis course aims to facilitate the development of your ability to think critically and express your ideas with care. The depth of your learning in this course cannot be assessed if Generative AI is aiding or doing this work for you. This course also encourages reflexivity - i.e. I will ask you often throughout the semester to reflect on and communicate your personal standpoint and how it impacts the way you write about cultural phenomenon. Since many generative AI algorithms act as “black boxes” (i.e. we don’t fully know what data they were trained on and how they operate internally) it’s not possible to be fully account for the standpoint from which generative AI text was generated.\nFurther, there are countless unresolved social concerns that stem from the use of generative AI - from the loss of cultural heritage, to the limiting of human aspirations and viewpoints, to the lack of formal mechanisms for regulating its potential social harms. Generative AI models often undermine scholarly values of credit by training on data harvested from across the internet that content creators have not provided express permission to use for these purposes. As an example, several academic journal articles that I have written were recently sold to Microsoft AI; I did not have an opportunity to opt out of this, and I will not receive any compensation for my contributions. Copyright laws have not been able to keep pace with the technology. This course will teach you how to interrogate how these kinds of social harms can emerge from data-based systems and imagine opportunities for mitigating them; the course itself suggests taking a precautionary approach in the absence of regulation and other safeguards.\nAccordingly, any use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. I will monitor for use of Generative AI by tracking the version history of your Google Documents. Any cases where a large portion of text is copy and pasted into the Document will be treated as plargiarism, unless you have communicated the rationale for doing so with me ahead of time."

Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. “What three words describe how you’re feeling?” “Name one challenge and one success from this week.” “What are you doing for self-care right now?” Thank each other for sharing where they’re at.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge that there is much we don’t know about how our colleagues experience the world. …but don’t ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of.\nCheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.\nAsk questions often in our #sds-237-questions channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nMistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on.\n\n\n\nUsing the proper pronouns for our students is foundational to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a culture of trust.

Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center. I can point you to these resources at any time throughout the semester.\n\n\nA trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response.

The observations were written up on 2023-02-19.\nMy stopwatch hits 20:00:00.\n“Alright, it’s been five minutes since I last asked, how rigorous do you feel your exercise is on a scale of 6-20?” I say, holding up a reference board for the participant. She points to a 12, which is labeled as “Somewhat hard.” She is on minute twenty of her acute bout of exercise, where she is walking at a moderate pace on the treadmill, and we are monitoring her heart rate from an electronic wristband.\nRecently, I have begun research work and analysis for the Witkowski Vascular Function Lab, and this was the first time I went in to observe a visit with a participant. I am new to the lab, and my perspective still feels a bit like an outsiders’. After the visit, I asked Dr. Witkowski explained that each number on the reference board corresponded to a heart rate by multiplying the number by 10, essentially acting as a participant’s heart rate experience. She explained to me how there are two different “data streams” throughout the lab, one being objective and the other subjective.\nThe idea of objective/subjective data is an example of a binary opposition: a pair of terms with opposite meanings. I noticed how much more “objective” data collection was valued, while a lot of the data collected from the participant was thought of as “subjective,” and thought of to be more subject to inaccuracy. Data is categorized as one or the other.\nNo data can be subjective, because the mere decision to begin collecting data means that there are expectations and biases put into the collection of data. Though the target heart rate is an “objective” part of the study because it is numerical, does not mean it is without bias. Heart rate calculations have historically ignored weight, height, average physical activity, and many other factors. This is just one example of how all of the data is biased, and cannot be placed into these categorizations. Additionally, the “data streams” figure of speech is a part of popular data discourse, contributing to the idea that data is a natural resource waiting to be found, untainted and untouched by human interference.\nDiscourse is the way that people talk about and engage with a certain thing/person, and dominant discourse can often characterize how we think about this topic as a society. The imagery of a data stream indicates that data is natural and is something we can “drink” from at any time. In reality, all data is collected from humans, who are limited in their standpoints and views."

    "text": "Units of Observation\n\nAny time we count something in the world, we are not only engaging in a process of tabulation; we are also engaged in a process of defining. If I count the number of students in a class, I first have to define what counts as a student. If someone is auditing the class, do they count? If I, as the instructor, am learning from my students, do I count myself as a student? As I make decisions about how I’m going to define “student,” those decisions impact the numbers that I produce. When I change my definition of “student,” how I go about tabulating students also changes. Thus, as we prepare to count observations in a dataset, it is important to know how those observations are defined.\n\n\nWhat does each row in your dataset represent?\nIn this dataset, each row is a _____.\n\n\nHow does that observation get defined in the data documentation?\n\nFind a definition for your unit of observation in the data documentation and cite it (with a citation) below.\n\nFill your response here.\n\n\nDevelop a timeline for this definition.\n\nDo some research on the agency website to determine when this definition was established and how it has changed over time.

For instance, if I was studying the National Bridge Inventory, I might type “what counts as a federal bridge”. Read through articles from multiple stakeholder perspectives (i.e. not just agencies). Can you identify any controversies or ambiguities about “what counts”? What are those controversies/ambiguities, and why did they emerge?\n\nFill your response here.\n\n\nWhat potentially relevant concerns are left out of the data due to the scope of this definition?\nFill your response here.\n\n\nThere are two sets of questions below - one set specific for categorical variables, and one set specific for numeric variables.

Following each, write a short caption to describe how the statement is reflective of broader sentiments towards the dataset. Be sure to distinguish between the author’s sentiments towards the dataset, and how the author conveys others’ sentiments towards the dataset.\n\nExample:\n\n“The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has released its Toxic Release Inventory for 2016 and the raw numbers don’t show a whole lot of difference over the past five years, but they show a significant decline over the past decade.”\n\n“17 Groups Petition EPA For Public Reporting Of Chemical Releases From Fracking, Other Oil And Gas Operations.” 2012. CNBC. October 24, 2012. https://www.cnbc.com/2012/10/24/17-groups-petition-epa-for-public-reporting-of-chemical-releases-from-fracking-other-oil-and-gas-operations.html.\nThe Toxic Release Inventory is often portrayed as documenting “raw” information about the annual state of pollution in the US. The data is leveraged by journalists and activists to convey evidence of changing environmental health conditions in the US. While certain environmental advocates and activists celebrate the publication of this data as a form of governmental transparency and accountability, they also lament its failure to address particular environmental issues warranting public concern:\n\n“The Toxics Release Inventory brings daylight to dark corners by requiring companies to quantify and report their pollution to a public data base for everyone to see,” said Environmental Integrity Project Director Eric Schaeffer. “That makes it easier for communities to measure the environmental impact of local industries, motivates companies to reduce their emissions, and gives all of us insight into how well our environmental laws are working. The EPA estimates the oil and gas industry releases 127,000 tons of hazardous air pollutants every year, second only to power plants and more than any of the other industries already reporting to TRI. Why shouldn’t oil and gas companies be required to report these toxic releases under our Right-to-Know laws, like so many other industries already do?”\n\n“Dealing with Emissions and Waste Can Cost Businesses Multiple Millions.” 2018. AP NEWS. February 11, 2018. https://apnews.com/article/496364d1d8aa48c29bda249e1e1313ff.\nSo while the data is often cast in a revelatory way, it is also critiqued for its shortcomings. In such cases, the data’s “raw”-ness gets implicitly called into question as they fail to reveal a comprehensive state of environmental health conditions.\n\n\nQuote 1\nFill your response here.\n\n\nQuote 2\nFill your response here.\n\n\nQuote 3\nFill your response here."

It can be really difficult to find people associated with a data collection program. Here are three strategies for “peopling this dataset”.\n\nStart at LinkedIn. Enter the name of your dataset in quotation marks (e.g. “National Bridge Inventory”) in the search bar. What kind of positions come up?\nSearch Google News for your dataset in quotation marks. What kinds of people are quoted in news articles about the dataset?\nSearch Twitter for your dataset in quotation marks. What kinds of people are tweeting about the dataset?\nCheck to see if there is an organization chart for the agency that runs the dataset. Can you figure out where the dataset is managed, and who runs that program?\n\nTwo important notes:\n\nYour list should be specific. You should provide more specificity than “data collectors” or “government agency employees” for instance. Try to identify who the data collectors are and what roles at which government agencies are implicated in the data collection.\nWhile you should be specific, you don’t need to list actual human names. You might list a person’s role (e.g. statistician at the EPA)\nBe careful not to confuse people with institutions. Congress, for instance, is an institution. Government is an institution.

    "text": "Course logo designed by Zoe Scheffler, Fall ’21\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout rich documentation, quantitative data can strip away critical context needed to interpret values responsibly. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of data ethnography, demonstrating how qualitative data collection and analysis can be brought to bear on the study of data settings and artifacts. Through experiential exercises, students will learn techniques in field-note writing, participant observation, in-depth interviewing, documentary analysis, and archival research and how they may be used to contextualize the cultural underpinnings of datasets. Students will learn how to visualize datasets in ways that foreground their socio-political provenance in R. Students will also learn how ethnographic methods can be leveraged to improve data documentation and communication. The course will introduce debates regarding the politics of techno-scientific fieldwork. Upon completion of this course, you should be able to:\n\nRecognize, interpret, and communicate the cultural underpinnings of data resources, infrastructures, and practices\nDefine and engage principal methods of ethnography and communicate when and how they may be used in the study of data\nStrategically apply relevant ethnographic methods to the study of a data setting or artifact\nProduce data documentation and visualizations that account for the cultural contexts of data production, categorization, measurement, and use\n\nClasses will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2:45 PM to 4:00 PM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Poirier, she/her/hers.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a cultural anthropologist that studies how civic data gets produced, how communities think about and interface with data, and how data infrastructure can be designed more equitably. My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to predominantly involve group activities and live problem-solving exercises.\n\n\n\nSlackMeeting with Me\n\n\nI can best support students in this course when I can readily keep tabs on our course-related communication. Because of this, I ask that you please don’t email me regarding course-related questions or issues. The best way to get in touch with me is via our course Slack. If you have course-related questions, I encourage you to ask them in the #sds-237-questions channel. When discretion is needed, feel free to DM. Please reserve more formal concerns like grades or accommodation requests for an in-person (or in-person virtual) conversation.\nDuring the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within 24 hours of receiving them. Please note that to maintain my own work-life balance, I don’t answer Slack messages late in the evenings or on the weekends. It’s important that you plan when you start your assignments accordingly.\n\n\nMeeting with me outside of class is a great opportunity for us to chat about what you’re learning in the course, clarify expectations on assignments, and review work in progress. I also love when students drop in to office hours to request book recommendations, discuss career or research paths, or just to say hi!\nThere are two ways to meet with me. If you would like to have a one-on-one private conversation, I ask that you schedule an appointment with me via the booking form on Moodle. For support on class topics, you may drop-in during my regularly scheduled office hours.\n\nTuesday, 1:30PM-2:30PM, McConnell 214\nThursday, 4:15-5:15PM, McConnell 214\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will make all course readings available on Perusall, which can be accessed through our course Moodle page.\n\n\n\nThis course will be graded via a grading contract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacobson Center\n\n\n\nSmith’s Jacobson Center asserts that all students can improve their communication and learning skills. I encourage all students to take advantage of their writing support services, workshops, and tutors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparationAttendanceExtensionsAcademic HonestyGenerative AI\n\n\nThis is a 4-credit course with 3 hours per week of in-classroom instructions. Smith expects students to devote 9 out-of-class hours per week to 4-credit classes. I have designed the course assignments and selected the course readings with this target in mind.\n\n\nBecause this course aims to hone certain critical thinking skills, much of the learning happens in class, in collaboration with peers. Attendance in class is both important for your own learning, and for your peers’ learning, as we will spend a good chunk of time in class engaging in group activities and discussions.\nAttendance will be taken each class period. That said, we all have reasons we can’t be available from time-to-time. You may miss three classes with no penalty. You do not need to inform me that you will be absent in these cases, but you should let your group members know. After the third unexcused absence, your grade may drop by a modifier for each class missed. I understand that you may need to be absent beyond these three sessions. Additional absences may be excused due to family/personal difficulties, sickness, or school or career-related activities; however, I will require some form of documentation for these absences. Please speak with your class dean or the Accessibility Resource Center so that we can get documentation of your need.\nI also ask that you make every effort to arrive to class on time. This is a large course, and when students arrive late, it can be distracting for me as the instructor, and it can be distracting to other students in the course. It also makes it difficult for me to plan group activities. Students arriving more than 10 minutes late for class without having informed me ahead of time will be marked as absent.\nIf you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed. Please note that the SDS Program has adopted a shared policy regarding in-person attendance:\n\nIn keeping with Smith’s core identity and mission as an in-person, residential college, SDS affirms College policy (as per the Provost and Dean of the College) that students will attend class in person. SDS courses will not provide options for remote attendance. Students who have been determined to require a remote attendance accommodation by the Accessibility Resource Center will be the only exceptions to this policy. As with any other kind of ADA accommodations, please notify your instructor during the first week of classes to discuss how we can meet your accommodations.\n\n\n\nThis course aims to support you in learning to become more perceptive to data environments surrounding you. Because of this I’ve deliberately spread course assignments out over the semester in order to help you gain practice in consistently paying attention to these environments. This critical mode of thinking can’t be cultivated effectively if the work is being crammed into later parts of the semester. Further, because this course emphasizes student growth over achievement, I also want to ensure that I can provide feedback on your writing in time for you to incorporate it into future assignments.\nThere is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\nNote that this policy does not apply to reading assignments/Perusall annotations. Reading assignments/Perusall annotations need to be completed by the due date for credit.\n\n\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as chatGPT\n\n\n\nThe use of generative artificial intelligence tools is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in a number of domains of work. Despite the urge to push forward with this innovative technology, there are both pedagogical and social reasons that I do not allow students to use generative AI in the context of this course.\nThis course aims to facilitate the development of your ability to think critically and express your ideas with care. The depth of your learning in this course cannot be assessed if Generative AI is aiding or doing this work for you. This course also encourages reflexivity - i.e. I will ask you often throughout the semester to reflect on and communicate your personal standpoint and how it impacts the way you write about cultural phenomenon. Since many generative AI algorithms act as “black boxes” (i.e. we don’t fully know what data they were trained on and how they operate internally) it’s not possible to be fully account for the standpoint from which generative AI text was generated.\nFurther, there are countless unresolved social concerns that stem from the use of generative AI - from the loss of cultural heritage, to the limiting of human aspirations and viewpoints, to the lack of formal mechanisms for regulating its potential social harms. Generative AI models often undermine scholarly values of credit by training on data harvested from across the internet that content creators have not provided express permission to use for these purposes. As an example, several academic journal articles that I have written were recently sold to Microsoft AI; I did not have an opportunity to opt out of this, and I will not receive any compensation for my contributions. Copyright laws have not been able to keep pace with the technology. This course will teach you how to interrogate how these kinds of social harms can emerge from data-based systems and imagine opportunities for mitigating them; the course itself suggests taking a precautionary approach in the absence of regulation and other safeguards.\nAccordingly, any use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of ConductPrinciples of CommunityPronouns\n\n\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack.\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nI hope that we can foster a collaborative and caring environment in this classroom: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities. Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. “What three words describe how you’re feeling?” “Name one challenge and one success from this week.” “What are you doing for self-care right now?” Thank each other for sharing where they’re at.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge that there is much we don’t know about how our colleagues experience the world. …but don’t ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of.\nCheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.\nAsk questions often in our #sds-237-questions channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nMistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on.\n\n\n\nUsing the proper pronouns for our students is foundational to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a culture of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodationsStudent Well-beingTrigger Warnings\n\n\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center. I can point you to these resources at any time throughout the semester.\n\n\nA trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I can’t always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I’ve set up an anonymous form, available on Moodle, where you can indicate topics for which you would like me to provide a warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoodlePerusallGoogle DriveSlack\n\n\nGrades, forms, and handouts will be available on the course Moodle.\n\n\nAll course readings and recorded lectures will be available on Perusall. You can access Perusall via our course Moodle page.\n\n\nThis semester, you will submit all of your assignments in a Google Drive folder that you will create on the first day of class. You can write your assignments in Google Docs, or you can work on your own computer and upload files to Google Drive. I just need to be able to open the files on my computer.\n\n\nOutside of class almost all of our communication will happen via Slack. You can use the following channels\n\n#general: Course announcements (only I can post)\n#sds-237-discussions: Share news articles and relevant opportunities\n#sds-237-questions: Ask and answer questions about our course\n#sds-237-class-notes: Find notes that a designated student took for our class on a given day\nYou can also create private Slack channels with your project group members."

If you receive an 80% or better on that quiz, it can replace one of your reading annotation assignments. If you receive a 100% on that quiz, it can replace two of your reading annotation assignments.\n\n\n\nDeadlines\nAssignments are due before class (2:45PM EST) on the designated due date. If you take the 24-hour grace period for written assignments (note that this is not an option for reading assignments), the assignment is due before (2:45PM EST) on the day following the designated due date. Any granted extensions are similarly due before 2:45PM EST on the date the deadline is extended to.\n\n\nEarning an A\nYou’ll notice that, in most categories, there’s no difference in the quantity of labor you need to complete to earn an A vs. a B. Earning a B in this course demonstrates that you have completed enough work to meet the course’s learning goals. An A grade in this course indicates that you have exceeded expectations of the course’s learning goals. Please note that this does not mean that you need to do more labor (i.e. more assignments) to earn A. Instead, you need to consistently demonstrate levels of critical thinking on existing course assignments that surpass the minimum requirements.\nTo earn an A in this course, you will need to complete 3 course assignments at an advanced level. You will select the assignments that you want to complete at this level from the labor log, giving you an opportunity to choose where you want to engage deeper. The following chart helps breakdown some of the differences between meeting expectations and exceeding expectations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting Expectations\nExceeding Expectations\n\n\n\n\nDefining and applying course concepts\nDrawing connections between course concepts, critiquing them, or extending them (i.e. offering new ways to think about them)\n\n\nCiting arguments from a course reading to support interpretation and ethnographic arguments\nEngaging more deeply with a course reading - unpacking how its arguments are supported and evaluating its relevance when applied to other ethnographic data\n\n\nImplementing an ethnographic research method\nDefending the selection of a research method and evaluating its strengths/limitations\n\n\nWriting up research findings to convey an argument\nExperimenting with the prose and form of argumentative writing with a clear analytic purpose\n\n\nReporting ethnographic findings in writing\nCritically situating the standpoints of your research findings throughout the writing\n\n\nAnalyzing how a social force shapes the constitution of data\nAnalyzing how multiple, at times competing, social forces shape the constitution of data\n\n\nClearly communicating the contexts that produced data in a format appropriate for a given audience\nCreatively playing with the style and medium of communication in order to better reach and engage an audience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that you may complete a reading annotation assignment at an advanced level by signing up to lead a 15-minute classroom discussion of that reading. I will remind you of this option throughout the first few weeks of the course. This is the only option for completing reading annotation assignments at an advanced level.\n\n\nThe labor log designates which assignments you may attempt to complete at an advanced level. You will be asked to justify why you consider your work on the assignment as advanced in the labor log. Please note that, when justifying why I should consider the work advanced in the labor log, you should clearly explain how the cognitive effort on the assignment surpasses minimum expectations. While you may end up writing more or spending more time on these assignments, exceeding the minimum word count or spending x hours on the assignment would not be considered adequate justification for advanced level work. Being able to justify why your work is advanced demonstrates to me that you have gained a deep understanding of the course’s learning objectives and that you have the ability to communicate what you’ve learned. While it is ultimately up to you to determine what constitutes advanced level work, I am happy to brainstorm ideas with you in office hours.\nPlease note that I reserve the right to deny advanced level designations after reviewing your work, and I also reserve the right to deem an assignment as having been completed at an advanced level, even when you haven’t designated it as such. If ultimately I deny a designation, you may attempt to earn the advanced level designation again. Note that this is a good reason not to wait until the end of the semester to attempt advanced level work.\nAttendance/late arrivals also separate A grades from B grades. Keep in mind that the final grade will be reduced by one grade modifier for each unexcused absence/late arrival beyond the number allowed for your contracted grade. This means that if you completed the work for an A, and you have 4 absences, the final grade will be an A-, and with 5 absences, it would be a B+. I chose to use grade modifiers here so that if you miss just one class beyond the first 3 allotted (i.e. 4 absences), it doesn’t drop your grade so drastically from an A to a B."

    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\n\nWhat kind of feedback will I receive regarding my work?\nYou will receive extensive and timely feedback on all of your submissions (from me and from your colleagues), and you will have opportunities to revise. I will also provide rubrics for most assignments to indicate how I will evaluate your work. However, you will not receive points or an A, B, C, D, etc. on individual assignments.\n\n\nThere appear to be a significant number of assignments and deadlines in this course. Why is this the case?\nI’ve been very deliberate in pacing your assignments for this course for a number of reasons. Developing the critical thinking skills required of ethnography demands building and consistently practicing observational habits. I want you to leave this class being more mindful of the cultural forces shaping the numbers you see everyday. You are being asked to complete several short reflective writing assignments for this course so that you can start to build those habits. I am aware that this will mean that, sometimes, the writing you produce for this course will not be the very best quality you can produce. Especially for the field note assignments, I have prioritized consistency over depth of reflection because the primary goal there is to encourage you to become more habitually observant. This is also why you have the opportunity to select assignments you want to invest more time on when aiming for an A. If you are struggling with this course’s workload, I recommend coming to talk with me in office hours.\n\n\nHow can I best keep track of my labor in this course?\nThroughout the semester, you will be asked to keep track of your labor via a log that you will share with me. I will reference this log to calculate certain aspects of your final grade. Instructions for using the labor log will be provided in the second week of the course.\n\n\nCan I earn +/- grades in this course?\n+/- will be assigned to final grades at my discretion in cases where a student’s work consistently exceeds the expectations (+) of their contracted grade or is in some way insufficient (-). Students can track their progress towards a grade modifier in feedback that I provide throughout the semester. Your grade may also be reduced by a grade modifier for each missed class beyond the number associated with your contracted grade.\n\n\nWhat if I need an extension on an assignment?\nThere is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments, except for reading annotations. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\n\n\nCan I ask for extensions or use the grace period for reading annotations?\nReading assignments/Perusall annotations prepare you to participate in class discussions. For this reason, they need to be completed by the due date for credit. I’ve provided considerable leeway to miss a reading annotation assignment from time-to-time in order to accommodate flexibility in this regard.\n\n\nWhat if I don’t know how to complete an assignment at an advanced level?\nIf you are not sure how to complete assignments at an advanced level, you should plan to come talk with me in office hours. I’m more than happy to help you brainstorm ideas!\n\n\nAn assignment deadline is approaching, and I’m unhappy with the quality of my work. What should I do?\nWhile I always encourage students to strive to submit the best work they can, this course’s grading contract, coupled with the course’s revision assignments, permits you to submit work that you know you want to continue to improve upon without penalty. Not submitting assignments at all has the potentially to significantly lower your grade in this course, whereas submitting an assignment that could benefit from more revision will not be detrimental to your grade as long as the minimum submission requirements are met."

Students leading a discussion should start by taking 2-3 minutes to summarize the main arguments of the reading, dicussing how the author supports those arguments. After this, it is up to the student(s) presenting how they wish to structure the remaining time. I’ve had students pose discussion questions to the whole class. I’ve also had students pose questions for small groups to discuss first (note that if you take this option, there is really only time to discuss at most 2 questions; trust me, the time goes by fast). I’ve also had students do more experimental things like create Kahoots or present case studies for the class to think through. It’s up to you! Just get us reflecting on the reading! Often students create slides to help structure the discussion, but this is not necessarily a requirement."
