## Reading Annotations

Most weeks a selection of course readings will be posted as a single assignment on Perusall - a system for students to collaboratively annotate course readings. You will be expected to post 3 quality annotations per assignment to Perusall. A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each otherâ€™s annotations.
