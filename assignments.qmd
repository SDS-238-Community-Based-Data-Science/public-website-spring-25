## Reading Annotations

Most weeks a selection of course readings will be posted as a single assignment on Perusall - a system for students to collaboratively annotate course readings. You will be expected to post 3 quality annotations per assignment to Perusall. A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each otherâ€™s annotations.

## Proposal Component 1

The proposal component 1 assignment is about getting the documents/policies together that will guide how we complete this project. There are two components to this assignment. 

1. You should complete CITI Training for Human Subjects Research. You can access this training by following the instructions at this [link](https://www.smith.edu/academics/institutional-review-board/application-process#required-online-ethics-training-(citi)-0). This should take 2-3 hours. Once you are done, you will receive a certificate in the form of a PDF. Please add that certificate to your Google Drive. 
2. Each project group will be assigned one section of a document that we discussed in class to flesh out into text. 

-   Data Management Plan - Data Assets and Data Storage/Security
-   Data Management Plan - Data Preservation/Disposition and Roles/Responsibilities of Data Stewardship
-   Project Ethics Protocol - Research Methods and Participants (inc. Recruitment Email)
-   Project Ethics Protocol - Informed Consent and Confidentiality (inc. Consent Form)
-   Project Ethics Protocol - Collection/Retention of Information, Risks, Benefits

Templates for these documents will be available in our Shared Google Drive.
