## Reading Annotations

Most weeks a selection of course readings will be posted as a single assignment on Perusall - a system for students to collaboratively annotate course readings. You will be expected to post 3 quality annotations per assignment to Perusall. A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each otherâ€™s annotations.

## Proposal Component 1

The proposal component 1 assignment is about getting the documents/policies together that will guide how we complete this project. There are two components to this assignment. 

1. You should complete CITI Training for Human Subjects Research. You can access this training by following the instructions at this [link](https://www.smith.edu/academics/institutional-review-board/application-process#required-online-ethics-training-(citi)-0). This should take 2-3 hours. Once you are done, you will receive a certificate in the form of a PDF. Please add that certificate to your Google Drive. 
2. Each project group will be assigned one section of a document that we discussed in class to flesh out into text. 

-   Data Management Plan - Data Assets and Data Storage/Security
-   Data Management Plan - Data Preservation/Disposition and Roles/Responsibilities of Data Stewardship
-   Project Ethics Protocol - Research Methods and Participants (inc. Recruitment Email)
-   Project Ethics Protocol - Informed Consent and Confidentiality (inc. Consent Form)
-   Project Ethics Protocol - Collection/Retention of Information, Risks, Benefits

Templates for these documents will be available in our [Shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iIbmV0Nd67fMtKELhwJrj65qKtRQwP8B?usp=drive_link).

## Proposal Component 2

For the first part of proposal component 2, your team should revise proposal component 1 based on my feedback. 

For the second part of proposal component 2, following an initial interview with the sponsor, each group will be assigned *two* of the following sections to elaborate (in 300-400 words each):

- Problem Definition
- Aims
- Methods
- Value
- Design Approach

Note that to complete the section you may need to conduct external research or refer back to the interview that was conducted in class. A transcript of the interview will be made available to you immediately after the interview is conducted. 

You may refer to the Scope of Work, as well as the slide deck developed on the second day of class, as you prepare your sections of the proposal. The slide deck includes a number of guiding questions in Notes about what should be included in each section. All of these documents can be located in our [Shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iIbmV0Nd67fMtKELhwJrj65qKtRQwP8B?usp=drive_link).

To submit this assignment, you should write both sections you have been assigned in a Google Document, shared among your team members. Be sure that each team member has a shortcut to the Google Document in their assignment folder. 

## Proposal Component 3

Proposal Component 3 has three parts:

1. Your team will be assigned one stakeholder that we outline in class. In 150-300 words, you should profile that stakeholder, indicating their interest in the project, their influence over the project, and ways that we will adapt our design approach in consideration of this stakeholder's stakes.
2. In 150-300 words you should profile your team, emphasizing your collective expertise, your standpoints, and the limits of your knowledge in relation to the project. Please note that you do not need to necessarily disclose aspects of your personal identity, but you may note the ways in which your team is diverse.
3. Your team will be assigned one design value that we outline in class. In 150-300 words, your team should define that value and outline how our design approach may shift to realize that value. Be sure to provide specific examples of how that value might impact the research activities or final outputs. 

To submit this assignment, you should write both sections in a Google Document, shared among your team members. Be sure that each team member has a shortcut to the Google Document in their assignment folder. 

## Code Reports

The instructions for the Code Reports can be found in the Code Reports folder in our [Shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iIbmV0Nd67fMtKELhwJrj65qKtRQwP8B?usp=drive_link). Everything you need to complete that assignment will be in that folder. 


## Collaboration Reflection

In 300-400 words, reflect on **your contributions** to supporting the collaborative dynamics in your project group. This write-up should focus on what **you** specifically are contributing to the group dynamics as opposed to how your team is operating more generally. What suggestions have you made to help your group collaborate better? Are you serving more as a leader or a follower in your group, and how has adopting that role shaped the group dynamic? How have you embodied the collaborative norms that your team outlined in the second week of class? What challenges have you faced in your group dynamics, and how have you navigated those challenges? Are there ways that you want to adjust your role in the group going forward? There is no required format for this write-up; it may be written like a journal entry. I simply want to see that you are reflecting on your personal role in your collaboration. 

These write-ups should be submitted in your personal portfolio in Google Drive.

## Independent Learning Reflection 

When we engage in "real world" data science projects, it is very often the case that we confront tasks that we do not currently know how to tackle. In this write-up, in 300-400 words, you should reflect on your personal experience of having to learn how to do things that you did not yet know how to do in the course project. What were some things you had to learn how to do to complete your assigned tasks? What were your first reactions to confronting an unfamiliar task? How did you engage in independent learning to figure out how to tackle that task? What resources did you engage? What was it like to acquire that knowledge and skill independently? Were there frustrations or celebrations along the way? Are there ways that you'd like to take better advantage of support resources available to you in the future? There is no required format for this write-up; it may be written like a journal entry. I simply want to see that you are reflecting on your personal role in advancing your learning. 

These write-ups should be submitted in your personal portfolio in Google Drive.


## Design Justice Reflection

In 700-800 words, you will reflect on the extent to which the practices you engaged and the work you completed for the final project embody the principles of design justice. More soon...
