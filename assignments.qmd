## Reading Annotations

Most weeks a selection of course readings will be posted as a single assignment on Perusall - a system for students to collaboratively annotate course readings. You will be expected to post 3 quality annotations per assignment to Perusall. A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each otherâ€™s annotations.

## Proposal Component 1

The proposal component 1 assignment is about getting the documents/policies together that will guide how we complete this project. There are two components to this assignment. 

1. You should complete CITI Training for Human Subjects Research. You can access this training by following the instructions at this [link](https://www.smith.edu/academics/institutional-review-board/application-process#required-online-ethics-training-(citi)-0). This should take 2-3 hours. Once you are done, you will receive a certificate in the form of a PDF. Please add that certificate to your Google Drive. 
2. Each project group will be assigned one section of a document that we discussed in class to flesh out into text. 

-   Data Management Plan - Data Assets and Data Storage/Security
-   Data Management Plan - Data Preservation/Disposition and Roles/Responsibilities of Data Stewardship
-   Project Ethics Protocol - Research Methods and Participants (inc. Recruitment Email)
-   Project Ethics Protocol - Informed Consent and Confidentiality (inc. Consent Form)
-   Project Ethics Protocol - Collection/Retention of Information, Risks, Benefits

Templates for these documents will be available in our [Shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iIbmV0Nd67fMtKELhwJrj65qKtRQwP8B?usp=drive_link).

## Proposal Component 2

For the first part of proposal component 2, your team should revise proposal component 1 based on my feedback. 

For the second part of proposal component 2, following an initial interview with the sponsor, each group will be assigned *two* of the following sections to elaborate (in 300-400 words each):

- Problem Definition
- Aims
- Methods
- Value
- Design Approach

Note that to complete the section you may need to conduct external research or refer back to the interview that was conducted in class. A transcript of the interview will be made available to you immediately after the interview is conducted. 

You may refer to the Scope of Work, as well as the slide deck developed on the second day of class, as you prepare your sections of the proposal. The slide deck includes a number of guiding questions in Notes about what should be included in each section. All of these documents can be located in our [Shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iIbmV0Nd67fMtKELhwJrj65qKtRQwP8B?usp=drive_link).

To submit this assignment, you should write both sections you have been assigned in a Google Document, shared among your team members. Be sure that each team member has a shortcut to the Google Document in their assignment folder. 

## Proposal Component 3

Proposal Component 3 has three parts:

1. Your team will be assigned one stakeholder that we outline in class. In 150-300 words, you should profile that stakeholder, indicating their interest in the project, their influence over the project, and ways that we will adapt our design approach in consideration of this stakeholder's stakes.
2. In 150-300 words you should profile your team, emphasizing your collective expertise, your standpoints, and the limits of your knowledge in relation to the project. Please note that you do not need to necessarily disclose aspects of your personal identity, but you may note the ways in which your team is diverse.
3. Your team will be assigned one design value that we outline in class. In 150-300 words, your team should define that value and outline how our design approach may shift to realize that value. Be sure to provide specific examples of how that value might impact the research activities or final outputs. 

To submit this assignment, you should write both sections in a Google Document, shared among your team members. Be sure that each team member has a shortcut to the Google Document in their assignment folder.
