## Some Terminology in Semiotics

- Signifier: a material thing that signfies something else (e.g. a number, an word, an expression)
- Signified: a concept that the signifier represents
- Indexical: cases where the signifier is assumed to have a direct causal relationship with the signified
  - e.g. My dog's tail wag signifies that she is happy.
  - e.g. 5 signifies the number of fingers on my hand.
- Symbolic: cases where is the signifier takes on meaning through culturally-specific interpretation of the signified

## Framing Statistics: Comparison/Ranking

- Is x more/less than y?
  - e.g. "Women make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes."
  - e.g. "The U.S. ranks first in firearm homicides in high income countries, with a rate of 4.52 firearm homicides per 100,000 population."

---

## Framing Statistics: Standards-setting/Benchmarking

- Identifying the yardstick to indicate "good" or "healthy"
  - e.g. "A credit score of 800 or above is 'excellent'."
  - e.g. "An AQI of 202 is 'very unhealthy'."

## Free-writing: Consider a **numeric** metric you use to measure something about yourself. Pick something that has special meaning for you. Is there a number that you strive for? How do you know when your score is "good"?

## Structured Story-tellling

1. Find a partner, and decide who will speak first and who will speak second.
2. Two minutes:
  - First speaker: Provides uninterrupted narration about this measure. What does it mean to you? How did it come to have its meaning? How do you decide what success looks like?
  - Second speaker: Listens with intention: What does this number mean to this person?
3. One minute:
  - Second speaker: Reflect back on what you heard/ask questions, etc. (e.g. "From what I understand...")
  - First speaker: Affirm, correct, clarify, but also listen for what they heard
4. Swap and repeat.
