## The Context

- We are supporting Solidago's Legacy project. 
- The Foundation is winding down operations this year. 
- They are seeking to summarize and historicize narratives from their decades of grant-making. 
- We will be helping them do so, specifically focused on their international grantees.

---

## The Problem

- The themes that Solidago wishes to document are dispersed across about 200 unstructured grant dockets (from 1999 to 2012).
- Some, but not all, of the dockets are digitized.
- Metrics to be analyzed have not yet been defined.
- Solidago is hoping that we can produce both quantitative data reports and also qualitative narratives from our analysis of the documents. 

---

## Skills 

- Interviewing
- Qualitative data analysis (inductive and deductive coding)
- Data visualization and story-telling
- Textual data analysis (possibly)
- Others to be determined as we scope the project as a class...

---

1. Navigate to Solidago's website
2. When was Solidago founded?
3. What does Solidago fund?
