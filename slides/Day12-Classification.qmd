## Identify a classification system that structures some aspect of your "work". How are concepts organized in this classification system?

---

## Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

- What is the master narrative running through this classification system?

# Reading Discussion

---

## Datasets that rely on the ICD

- Navigate to [data.gov](data.gov) and search for "ICD"
- How do these datasets rely on the ICD?

## Mini-Project 1

- Due October 17 (in 2 weeks)
- Choice between a discourse analysis or a cultural analysis of infrastructure
- Both involve practicing the **methods** we have discussed in class
- Both involve producing an **argument** from ethnographic evidence
- Argument should be *descriptive*, not of *value* or *policy*
- Video describing both projects in depth will be available on Perusall
