# Make a long list of everything (both material and non-material) that enabled you to arrive in class today. What had to exist for this to be possible?

## Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

Pick one supporting infrastructure: 

- How often do you think about this infrastructure? 
- Is it always an enabling infrastructure? When might it not be?

## Relationality of Infrastructure

> infrastructue is a fundamentally relational concept, becoming real infrastructure in relation to organized practice.

- Often we think of infrastructure as "just there"
- Assumes that infrastructure is the same thing for all people all of the time
- Viewing infrastructure as "relational" acknowledges that certain things *become* infrastructure to different people in different moments
- Not so much "what is infrastructure" but "when is infrastructure"

---

## Star's Definition of Infrastructure

- Embeddedness: Sunk into other socio-technical structures
- Transparency: Does not need to continuously be reassembled
- Reach or Scope: Connects more than one site
- Learned as part of membership: Use naturalized through communities of practice
- Embodiment of standards: Component parts can connect through standardized conventions
- Built on an installed base: Wrestles with the logics of its underlying infrastructures
- Visible upon breakdown: Often taken for granted until breaking

---

## Master Narratives

- Singular voice designed into infrastructures that do not attend to diversity
- Assumed to speak for everyone
- Identifying involves asking: what has been made other by the design of this infrastructure?

---

## Invisible Work

- Work that fades into the background when presenting an infrastructure
- Sometimes invisible because that work is "tacit" or rote
- Sometimes structurally hidden from view
- Identifying involves asking: what forms of labor tend to go unrecognized when looking at this infrastructure
