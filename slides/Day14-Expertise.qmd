## Draw a "map of data science" - sort of like you would draw a map of the world. What's at the center of your map? What features are at the periphery? What are the far-off lands outside of its borders? Where are the mountains? Rivers? Forbidden areas?

---

## Turn to a neighbor and discuss:

- How does your map reflect certain assumptions of what counts as data science vs. non-data-science?

# Reading Discussion

---

## Boundary Work

- Examines the work that society does to set the boundaries of science vs. non-science
- Acknowledges that differently situated people have different ways of justifying what makes something scientific vs. non-scientific
- Helps establish science's epistemic authority through credibility contests and cartographic contrast

---

## How do we decide what is pseudo-science?

## Positioning Data Science on the Map

- Where we place data science in relation to other disciplines matters
- Does data science sit separately from domains? Does it sit outside them? Above them? What does this convey about data science?
