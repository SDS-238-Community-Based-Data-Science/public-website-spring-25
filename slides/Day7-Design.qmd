## Partcipatory Design, or co-design

- Generally involves including users in the design process
- Users may be involved in ideation, sketching, building, and/or evaluating
- Can diversify design teams and make outputs more relevant and accessible to user
- Need to balance inclusion with the ways participation may be taxing on certain communities

---

## Values-Sensitive Design

- Every design manifests a certain set of values, whether explicit or implicit
- Design can be targeted towards values that we hold as humans (e.g. equitable access, fair representation, efficiency)
- VSD involves articulating values at the outset and tailoring practices and products in those ways

---

## Also...

- Reflective Design
- Speculative Design
- Critical Making
- Devious Design
